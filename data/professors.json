      "Hydrogen interaction in metal can be both advantageous and catastrophic. Hydrogen is beneficially used in the direct reduction of iron. The steel making industry accounts for 8% of worldwide CO2 emissions, and to achieve low carbon goals by 2050, alternative extraction methods must be developed. Traditional blast furnace techniques have an energy consumption of 19.8 GJ/t, yet direct reduction via hydrogen based low temperature electrolysis reduces this to 13 GJ/t. By developing corrosion resistant electrode materials for direct reduction via the understanding of hydrogen in this process, my group is increasing resilience in the UK steel supply chain, whilst contributing to the global responsibility of reducing CO2 emissions.

The fundamental effects of hydrogen in materials such as zirconium and titanium are not fully understood. Hydrogen transport and storage in renewable technologies has a need for protection against hydrogen embrittlement to prevent catastrophic failure. In detecting, measuring, and tracking hydrogen in these materials, a deeper understanding of current embrittlement theories can be formed. ",

His research focuses on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), their multidisciplinary applications in long-term climate change mitigation scenarios, and data analytics to explore mitigation strategies. Alaa's interest encompasses various mitigation approaches, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures. Alaa is recently focused on exploring the impacts of disruptive events (socioeconomic, technological, or environmental) on long-term mitigation scenarios using IAMs. His interest in scenarios data analytics covers decomposition methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering techniques, and vetting of scenarios data. Alaa is also interested in applications of models' linking, and currently exploring role of finance sector dynamics in IAMs. Drawing from his past experience with the IPCC, Alaa has broader interests including enhancing climate change assessments by promoting FAIR data principles and carefully leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to augment scientific assessment processes.",

      "Alaa has been a Research Fellow at Imperial College London since 2019. During the first three years of his fellowship, he served as a full-time Senior Scientist at the Technical Support Unit of Working Group III (WGIII - Climate Mitigation) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He supported the production of the 6th Assessment Report (AR6), where he is also a Contributing Author. His contributions to the assessment were focused on topics related to integrated assessment modelling, and the assessment of long-term mitigation scenarios. He also served as an Ex-Officio Member of the IPCC’s Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data). Alaa contributed to the AR6 Scenarios Database international outreach activities and supported international processes at UNFCCC and SBSTA (such as the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement) in communicating the results of the WGIII assessment report. Given Alaa’s involvement in AR6, he was recently selected to join the IPCC team, which met Members of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to provide scientific insights in preparation for the case on ‘obligations of States in respect of climate change’, following the United Nations General Assembly resolution 77/276.",

      "The PhD project was concerned mostly with measuring the joint kinematics, contact areas and analysing the muscles in order to derive the forces on the elbow during highly-loaded activities.",

      "The work in Leeds led to the design and clinical trial of an elbow prosthesis and related instruments, which was patented and licensed to Howmedica for manufacture. The clinical work was in collaboration with Mr Jim Miller, of Glasgow Royal Infirmary.",
      "A spin-off from the total elbow prosthesis was a system of radial head prostheses, for use in unstable fracture-dislocations of the elbow. These implants are still marketed by Stryker and by Corin.",
      "",
      "Concerns about joint stability led into work on artificial ligaments, with work initially on carbon fibres, but later on polyester fibres. This included collaboration with Professor Jimmy Campbell and Dr Susan Kempson, of the Edinburgh University Veterinary School, who used the implants for a large series of injured dogs' knees, and studied the tissue reactions to the fibres, showing the formation of new collagenous tissue on the polyester scaffold.",
      "",
      "The polyester ligament system was then engineered for human use, including extensive fatigue-creep testing, in collaboration with DePuy Ltd and DuPont Ltd. A multi-centre clinical trial was set up, with particular collaboration with Mr Sadhan Mukherjee, of Airdrie Hospital, who introduced arthroscopic methods.",
      "",
      "Although artificial ligaments fell out of use, the work on the stability of the knee continued, with early work examining the roles of fibre bundles within the cruciate ligaments; that led to development of double-bundle ligament reconstruction methods which gave a closer approximation of natural knee laxity behaviour. This led to membership of both the Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligament Study Groups, and Andrew was the inaugural International Research Professor of the ACL Study Group in 2003.",
      "",
      "A related line of work was the measurement of complex knee instabilities, and work to attach electromagnetic sensors directly to the bones of patients during ligament surgery, and then later to splints for mounting the sensors on the skin, for routine clinical use.",

      "Dr Andrew Ashley’s research interests pivot around the catalytic activation of dihydrogen into proton and hydride equivalents, in order to bring about a step change in the reactivity of the hydrogen molecule with reducible substrates. Systems capable of such a transformation are the recently discovered ‘Frustrated Lewis Pairs’ (FLPs) which are based on non-metal components such as amines and Lewis acidic boranes. In conjunction with efforts to design new thermally and hydrolytically stable FLPs, novel metal-based systems capable of effecting the reversible splitting of hydrogen are also being investigated. The primary goal is then to effect the hydrogenation of important small molecules (which are coordinated to transition metal based co-catalysts), mediated by sequential ‘proton coupled hydride transfer’ using activated hydrogen. Since hydrogen can be synthesised from the splitting of water using renewable solar energy we can obtain routes to the chemical storage of hydrogen and thus energy.",

      "Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide into hydrocarbons and water.  ",
      "In the case of carbon monoxide this is known as the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and is currently performed heterogeneously and at elevated temperatures and pressures; it generally exhibits poor selectivity. Since carbon monoxide can be made through the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (albeit endothermically), conducting this reaction in parallel with a homogeneous FT reaction (strongly exothermic) would enable the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons for use as carbon-neutral ‘green’ fuels, or feedstock chemicals (carbon sequestration). Such co-catalysts are based on mid-late transition metals of the 1st and 2nd row.",

      "Fixation of dinitrogen to ammonia.  ",
      "The Haber process produces all synthetic ammonia from dihydrogen and dinitrogen that humans use for fertiliser to improve agricultural yields and hence help feed the world population. However, it does so at an immense energy cost (ca. 2% global energy demand) due to operation at high temperatures and pressure. Since iron is used in this process, and an iron-only nitrogenase has been discovered in Nature, co-catalytic dinitrogen iron(II) complexes are the focus of this research to devise a pathway for nitrogen hydrogenation at ambient temperatures and pressure.",
      " ",
      "Many aspects of these transformations are applicable to an industrial context, where reactions are often conducted at high temperatures. Accordingly the design of new thermally robust ligands and their coordination complexes is an important aspect of our current methodology. All targets are homogeneous systems which are amenable to study using conventional techniques (e.g. NMR and IR spectroscopy) and thus offer the benefit of improving product selectivity through rational ligand modification."

      "My research group is interested in a variety of topics related to the vertebrate craniofacial (head) development, craniofacial genetic conditions in humans and craniofacial developmental evolution. We use morphometric, molecular, cellular and genetic approaches to study the precise mechanisms of cranial skeletal cell differentiation and skull/face morphogenesis in amniotes. The species we work with range from the laboratory \"model\" systems, such as chicken embryos and mouse mutants, to the \"non-model\" species used for evolutionary developmental studies, for example, Darwin's Finches and their relatives from Caribbean Islands, as well as other birds and, more recently, reptiles, both squamates (e.g. Anolis lizards), and archosaurs, such as alligators. This combination of laboratory \"model\" species with \"non-model\" species from natural environments allows us to address important conceptual questions, such as the roles of particular developmental genetic mechanisms (e.g. modularity) in evolution of adaptive variation and significant morphological transitions at both small and large evolutionary scales.",
      " ",
      "Generally, our studies on evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) have a tripartite structure of the overall approach: 1) The first step is quantification of morphological variation using methods ranging from simply scoring the absence or presence of particular structures to 3D imaging and modeling; 2) The second component is identification of candidate genetic and developmental mechanisms using methods ranging from observations of the trait as it emerges in real time to quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to microarray and RNAseq screens;3) The third part is functional assays of candidate genes/pathways to reveal the more causative relationships by methods ranging from physical manipulations to tissue and embryo transgenesis with molecular vectors.",

A major focus of this research is to understand how to direct the process of tissue repair by manipulating signalling networks. These insights are then used to develop methods for healing diabetic foot ulcers, preventing hypertrophic scarring, and modulating other wound healing disorders. More information can be found on the lab website.",

Primarily, they encode conditional independence assumptions, whereby A is statistically independent of B conditional on the value of C. Just as conditional probability is one of the pillars of modern probability, conditional independence is critical in statistical modelling. It underlies model specification, and allows us to infer, elicit, and understand correlation structures between unobserved variables, given the value s of variables we already know. This course will entail a variety of material, including discrete mathematics (graph theory), statistical modelling, algorithms and computational aspects, as well as applications, involving real data and actual applications. We will also touch upon abstract questions, such as the difference between causality and correlation.",

Were the policies of our government succesful? Sound policy making must rely on evidence, and the task of gathering such evidence reliably across a multitude of individuals, social groups, businesses and types of activities, is monumental. This is an exciting time for official statistics: the raw data are increasingly becoming available for public scrutiny, and recent developments are redefining what constitutes \"well-being\", \"progress\", and how they can be measured."

Her research is focused on multiscale process and molecular/materials design, including the development of design methods, property prediction techniques and optimisation algorithms. She works extensively with industry, especially the oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals sectors and has licensed thermodynamic modelling software.

      "Dr Adjiman's group brings molecular-level decisions into process design through fundamental advances in modelling and optimisation methods, and follows this through to implementation and application.",
      " ",
      "In designing new processes e.g., chemical processes, energy conversion devices – the molecules or materials required for processing (such as solvents or catalysts) are often chosen first. This is usually done from a limited set of choices (or design space) because evaluating many options, computationally or experimentally, is costly and time-consuming. Once this choice is made, the process topology and operating conditions can be chosen. This sequential decision making can lead to poor performance as it limits the design space and it ignores the intrinsic links between molecules and process. A simple question such as what is the best solvent for a reaction in a pharmaceutical manufacturing process cannot be answered in isolation. The answer depends on the reactor temperature and pressure, and on what follows in the process. If it is another reaction, it may be best to find a single solvent that works reasonably well for both reactions, to avoid expensive steps such as “swapping” one solvent for another, which often requires an energy-intensive separation.",
      " ",
      "By extending the boundary of process design to include molecular or material level decisions, real benefits can be accrued: better process economics, and lower environmental impact through increased material and energy efficiency. Further, by using optimisation to pose and solve extended design problems, the explicit evaluation of every design is avoided, making it possible to consider large design spaces: thousands of molecules, countless mixtures, wide temperature/pressure ranges, unusual process topologies. A few promising designs can be assessed experimentally to verify the results of model-based design. This general methodology, integrated molecular and process design, has been singled out for its potential to enhance innovation and competitiveness.",

(i) To present the basic ethical frameworks used in current approaches to ethics in AI, the methods used in designing artificial agents which conform to instances of such frameworks, and to equip the students with the skills of analysis needed to reason about ethical dilemmas in AI. (ii) To present ways of measuring and preventing biased decision making by ML models, and the accuracy/fairness trade-off; to give students the practical tools to define and measure the fairness of ML algorithms. (iii) To present the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its impact on AI that involves personal data, as a key illustrative example of an important law affecting AI/ML, given the risk of large potential fines/compensation claims under the GDPR in practice; other selected laws (e.g., on anti-discrimination) will also be highlighted.\"",

      "Fater Akuhwa is a PhD student in the Control and Power group, department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. His PhD research under the supervision of Professor Timothy Charles Green and Professor Mark O'Malley focuses on proposing trade-offs in grid and IBR co-design for the provision of system services in the 100% renewable electricity grid. System services were previously provided by synchronous generators and tied to their inherent characteristics. A choice therefore exists between modification of inverters to provide those services or enhancement of the grid in some way as to use less or different services. Rather than this being a strict choice between two options, it should be viewed as striking a compromise somewhere between these options to find the least cost solution. The current phase of his research explores how mechanisms to ensure less angle deviation between resources and well-chosen \"mho\" regions in protection relays can achieve high levels of selectivity without needing to increase current fault levels through additional hardware.

From May - August 2024, he visited the University of Toronto as a recipient of Imperial's Turing Award to conduct research related to protection of power systems with a high penetration of inverter-based resources. Fater serves as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in various modules including Mathematics for Engineers, Topics in Electrical Engineering, and Power Systems and Power Electronics."

Current research interest is focused on the regulation of gene expression by ambient pH and calcium signalling and homeostasis.  The  pH regulatory system controls expression of genes involved in  metabolite (eg toxins and antibiotics) export, extracellular enzymes and  nutrient uptake and its functioning is crucial for fungal infections of  both plants and animals.  The calcium project originated  from the identification of a novel mutational combination which results  in strains requiring high levels of calcium for growth and an indicator  activity which reflects calcium status.  Work done elsewhere indicates that perturbation of calcium signalling/homeostasis is likely to prevent fungal virulence as well.",

      "His current global prowess as an iconic contributor to medical innovations on neonatology in the world has been greatly influenced by his academic exploits, both as a student and later staff/Professor at the prestigious Imperial College London, United Kingdom. During this period, he had been celebrated in innovation and discoveries across medical disciplines as: (1) The discovery of the mathematical model that relates the capsular-insertion neck of the human proximal humerus to its anatomical neck in 2006; a discovery that enhanced the development of modern predictive tools for the planning of shoulder surgeries (2) The innovation of Recycled Incubator Technology (RIT) for neonatal incubator interventions in 2003 (3) The discovery of tropical Evening-fever Syndrome (EFS) in the neonate in 2012 and its antidote against neonatal hyperthermia in 2014 (4) The innovation of the Handy Approach (HHA) in 2012 and the Initial set-point algorithm (HISA) in 2016 for interventions against high neonatal mortality orchestrated by high incidence of neonatal thermal stress in low and middle-income countries (5) The innovation of Politeheart ventilator - a bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device in 2017 (6) The innovation of Polite-oxygen supply splitter system -the PSS - in 2019 (7) The invention of Polite02Blend in 2019 - an oxygen-air blender system for neonatal respiratory support, etc.",

      "His current practice spanned across the entire regions of Nigeria, reaching over 30 tertiary hospitals, in the last two decades. He has since been a regular in the WHO and World Bank list of global thinkers on impact of climate change on neonatal health from the African perspective. His Nigerian research group members are located at hospitals across the entire geopolitical zones of Nigeria; enabling him an unprecedented access to evidence based data on a national representative scale [http://neonatalconcerns.org]. He has led these groups to devise globally applaudable medical procedures and devices, with much global recognition, including the Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine (FRSM).",

      "Dr Holger Auner received his MD from Karl-Franzens University Graz, Austria, where he also trained in Internal Medicine/Haematology-Oncology and studied genetic instability in myeloid leukaemias in the laboratory of Professor Heinz Sill. He then joined the group of Professor Niall Dillon at the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre as a Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund Junior Research Fellow and obtained his PhD for work on plasma cell biology from Imperial College London. Subsequently, he was the Stem Cell Transplant Co-ordinator in the Centre for Haematology at Hammersmith Hospital. He was awarded a Cancer Research UK Clinician Scientist Fellowship in 2012 and a Cancer Research UK Advanced Clinician Scientist Fellowship in 2019, when he became Head of Translational Research at Imperial's newly established Hugh and Josseline Langmuir Centre for Myeloma Research. In 2022, Dr Auner became Professor of Clinical and Molecular Haemato-oncology at Imperial College. Dr Auner’s primary research interest is to better understand the molecular mechanisms that coordinate protein degradation pathways with cellular metabolism in multiple myeloma and other cancers, with the ultimate goal of finding novel therapeutic approaches. His lab, the Cancer Cell Protein Metabolism group, also investigates how proteomic and metabolic homeostasis depend on tissue physical properties and vice versa, using time-resolved omics approaches in a range of cross-disciplinary collaborations. Dr Auner is an active member of the European Myeloma Network (EMN), was Principal Investigator for Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust for several phase 1 to 3 national and international trials, and Translational Research Lead of the UK Myeloma Research Alliance (2020 - 2023). In April 2023, he became Head of the Hematology service and central hematology laboratory at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Full Professor at the University of Lausanne.  ",

      "I got my PhD degree from the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department at Imperial College London. My research is mainly focused on the interaction of gas/hydrogen and electricity systems from operation and planning perspectives. In this context, the modelling is carried out for e.g., GB energy system in 2030 and 2050, where a significant part of the heat and transport sector should be electrified. Furthermore, cost-effective transition to a lower-carbon energy system achieved by the employment of flexibility options (i.e., demand side response, electricity storage, flexible gas plants, multi-directional compressors, and interconnections) in the integrated operation and planning of different energy vectors (mainly gas/hydrogen, heat and electricity) is investigated. I was a Co-Investigator in the \"Whole system analysis of advanced thermal energy storage technologies in future UK energy networks\"  project. I am a Contributing Author in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) WG 3 and contributed to many scientific papers as well as research projects related to the energy industry, such as projects for the Committee of Climate Change (CCC) and Ofgem."

Throughout this time she developed an interest in stem cell transplantation (SCT), and by default in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), which was the primary indication for SCT in the 1990s. She spent two years as a post-doctoral fellow at the Children’s Hospital in Boston, USA, training in gene transfer and therapy. She returned to the Hammersmith Hospital in 1993, was given a personal chair in Haemato-Oncology in 2002, and became the Clinical Director for Clinical Haematology at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, and the Chair of the Centre of Haematology at the Imperial College in 2003/4. She stepped down from both posts in 2021. In 2022 she was appointed to the position of Campus Director for the Hammersmith-White City Campus of Imperial College.",

She has reviewed national and international grant awards including acting as Chair of the European Research Council ‘Starting Investigators’ program. ",

      "Her interests remain the biology and management of CML, and her group at the Imperial College has extensive experience in the use of first, second and third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly in the areas of molecular monitoring, mechanisms of drug resistance and adverse events. She has a long-standing interest in the impact of haematological diseases and their treatment on fertility, pregnancy and foetal outcome. She has been a member of the ELN CML Working Party since the creation of the ELN in 2004 and has been involved with the ELN Consensus Guidelines since the first recommendations in 2006, initially as the ‘expert’ in SCT but will now lead the next version of the guidelines, with a predicted publication date of 2024."

      "Javier Alegre-Abarrategui combines academic work as Clinical Reader in Neuropathology and Director of Neuropathology of the MS & PD Tissue Bank in the Department of Brain Sciences at Imperial College and clinical work as Consultant Neuropathologist at Charing Cross Hospital and University College London Hospitals (Queen Square Institute of Neurology, Department of Neuropathology).  A Neurologist and Neuropathologist by training, he previously worked at the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics at Oxford. He’s research focused on genetically-defined forms of PD, the use of human genomic constructs for animal and in vitro functional modelling and autophagy. He has pioneered the development of novel tools to detect in situ early protein aggregates such as alpha-synuclein oligomers in human brain and a novel assay to visualise seeding activity in situ. He is applying these tools to the dissection of the initial pathogenic processes in PD and Alzheimer’s disease, including gene expression pathway alterations linked to the earliest pathological events. He has led a study that has provided a new staging system for the neuropathology of PD incorporating glial alongside neuronal pathology. He directs the provision of  Neuropathology for the MS & PD Tissue Bank at the College as well as for academic and clinical colleagues and tissue users and he leads a research portfolio centred on the Tissue Bank specimens. He is looking forward to meeting colleagues from different disciplines interested in developing novel and exciting ideas to use human tissue for research."

Her clinical interests include acute respiratory infection, acute lung injury and the role of ultrasound in critical care.",
      "",
      "Joana started her PhD in July 2014 under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Hind, Dr. Charlotte Dean and Dr. Mark Griffiths. Her focus of research is on lung injury and repair pathways in human models based on ex vivo lung perfusion technology (EVLP) using a human precision lung cut slice model. She is also looking to explore how specific pathways important in embryonic development, such as retinoic acid metabolism (RA), have the potential induce regeneration of the human lung. It has been demonstrated that the lung has a far greater degree of plasticity than previously thought and that molecules such as RA might be used to prevent deterioration, promote direct repair or even tissue regeneration. This could lead to the development of disease-modifying therapies that can repair and restore lung function in diseases such as emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS."

John has worked predominantly within the Pharmaceutical Industry, specialising in respiratory physiology and pharmacology, and has focused primarily on novel drug discovery. With about '40' years in the business (26 years at the Wellcome Research Laboratories, 6 years as Co-founder, Director and Chairman of Pneumolabs (UK) Ltd and 8 years at Pfizer), his recognised expertise in sensory neuropharmacology, particularly in airway disease (including asthma, COPD and chronic cough), led to over 30 peer-reviewed publications and invited presentations.  During his time in industry, John has been involved with managing teams of research scientists, identifying and developing novel targets for drug discovery, influencing Clinical Project Investigations as well as producing expert reports for marketing. John has extensive experience and worked on many potential novel therapeutic agents for lung disease including bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory and sensory nerve targets. Throughout his time in the industry, John also took great pleasure in lecturing/supervising undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students as well as examining PhD candidates. He was elected a Fellow of the British Pharmacological Society in 2013. ",

      "One of John's great passions is cough which is arguably the most common symptom associated with pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, bronchitis, COPD, the common cold and, in itself, as a standalone condition in the form of chronic cough. Thus, John shares many interests and, as an honorary member, relishes the opportunity to support the research activities of the group."

In 2009 she was awarded her PhD from Lund University after performing structural and functional studies on apolipoprotein M in Professor Björn Dahlbäck's lab. Following on from her PhD, Josefin joined the Thrombosis and Haemostasis group, led by Professor David Lane and Professor James Crawley, at the Centre for Haematology at Imperial College as a post-doc in September 2009. During her post-doc, she developed an interest in the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of coagulation. In 2013 she was awarded a BHF-funded Intermediate Basic Science Research Fellowship and was appointed as a Lecturer in October 2019 and promoted to Senior Lecturer in September 2022.",

The research conducted within our Theme focusses on improving our understanding of the role of inflammatory mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and stroke. In addition, the research capabilities of the Theme have been expanded and strengthened with the research work carried out on prevention, assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly those linked with emotional dysregulation. It is a privilege for me to support a team of world-class scientists to discover disease mechanisms and risk factors that underpin new diagnostics and therapies for all those conditions.",

I hold a PhD in Psychology and in my research work I explored the cognitive and anatomical correlates of neglect for peripersonal (near) and extrapersonal (far) space. In my subsequent research positions, I conducted multicentre clinical trials with neurological and psychiatric patients from study set-up to closure. In addition, I carried out a randomised controlled trial of a quality improvement network for low-secure forensic mental health services to examine the impact of network membership on the process and outcomes of care.",

These MRes projects turned into my current PhD project supervised by the aforementioned principal investigators in addition to Dr Marina Evangelou. My project focuses on the testing and development of novel statistical methods for the mutli-omic integration of sequencing-based datasets in the context of ER breast cancer evolution, and it is done in collaboration with the Institute of Cancer Research."

      "Our research is focused on, Gram negative bacterial secretion systems, regulation, biofilm formation factors, antimicrobial resistance and virulence of pathogens. Secretion systems enable bacteria to export proteins into the environment or directly into host cells or rival bacteria. These systems play a role in enabling the bacteria to subvert the host, obtain nutrients and compete with other bacteria in a particular environment. A biofilm is a community of bacteria growing within a self-produced matrix. Biofilms are a challenge for medicine because they are less susceptible to antibiotics, phage, detergents and the host immune system. How bacteria sense and deploy secretion systems, biofilm programs and other factors to prosper in response to their environmental challenges fascinates us. We are happy to support competitive and eligible PhD candidates for the Presidents Scholarships and can also explore other options for funding. My team has obtained funding from ESCMID, Academy of Medical Sciences, BBSRC, LifeArc and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.",

There I focused on the characterization of new adhesins in uropathogenic Escherichia coli for their role in biofilm formation, adhesion and virulence. In 2013 I joined the research group of Professor Alain Filloux at the MRC Centre for Bacteriology and Infection at Imperial College and I switched to focus on the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 2014 I was awarded and commenced a Marie Currie Fellowship investigating biofilm formation and the type six secretion system.

      "Earth’s magnetic field acts a barrier to the solar wind, forming our magnetosphere with a bow shock upstream that slows and deflects the supersonic plasma around it. However, this is a highly dynamic and non-linear process with many complicated feedback mechanisms. These result in various transient phenomena which can have localised and even global impacts on the magnetosphere affecting the energetic particles in the radiation belts, electrical currents directed into and through the top of the atmosphere, auroral processes and launching a cacophony of different ultra-low frequency waves analogous to sound. These impacts can severely impact on our space- and ground-based technology and infrastructure, resulting in technological, economic and societal repercussions known as space weather. My research career has focused on many of these dynamical processes, investigating their origins, properties and consequences.",

      "Neil Alford received his BSc from St Andrews University and spent three years working in SE Asia and S America in the Oil Exploration Industry.  He returned to the UK to carry out his PhD at Queen Mary College in the area of fracture mechanics of cement mortars. He carried out post doctoral work at Oxford University in collaboration with ICI developing high strength cement. He joined ICI Corporate Laboratory in 1981 and was involved with projects concerning macro defect free cement, viscous processing of ceramics and the properties of perovskite ceramics, specifically High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). The application of HTS to microwave devices was a major area and part of this activity has been now transferred to industry for cellular communications. He joined London South Bank University in 1994 and developed HTS Magnetic resonance receive coils, microwave dielectrics, novel signal transformers and ferroelectric thin films. His work on microwave dielectric materials has resulted in the development of ultra low loss alumina resonators and an understanding of the defect chemistry of TiO2 which has allowed the production of very high Q and high dielectric constant materials. This technology has been patented and transferred to industry.",
      " ",
      "Technology transfer is a key focus and Neil’s discoveries have been applied widely in industry, including cellular communications. His research on low loss microwave dielectrics and functional materials led to the development of the first room temperature, earth’s field MASER (a Microwave laser).    At Imperial he has served as Head of Department of Materials, Vice Dean for Research in the Faculty of Engineering and Associate Provost.  In 2013 he was awarded the MBE for services to Engineering.",

      "My research focuses on determining the functions and activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic Nod-like receptors (NLRs). NLRs modulate several anti-microbial functions including the activation of NF-kB and inflammasomes, a multimeric complex consisting of an NLR member together with adaptor ASC and pro-Caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been extensively studied largely due to its’ roles in infectious and inflammatory disorders. However, the activation mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome remain ambiguous. We are interested in understanding how cellular metabolic pathways impact inflammasome activity. Our recent studies demonstrated cellular cholesterol transport as a key homeostatic mechanism regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome thereby highlighting a new perspective on the metabolic control of inflammasome. We are now interested in further characterizing the cholesterol transport pathways to decipher how they impact inflammasome activation and cellular metabolism, and whether these pathways might affect immune responses to pathogenic and ‘sterile’ stimuli. Our studies would lead to the identification of targets that calibrate immune responses to maintain cellular homeostasis."

      "I have used routinely collected clinical and administrative data to examine variations in quality and safety in healthcare. My research has increased the use of data in the management and monitoring of healthcare in the UK and internationally. My work has led to the development of innovative statistical and computational methods for processing large data sets derived from electronic medical records and NHS databases. In my work examining paediatric cardiac surgical outcomes for the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry, I confirmed serious concerns around the surgical outcomes at Bristol and established the usefulness of routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics) in helping to identify quality of care issues.  In further research commissioned by the Shipman Inquiry and published in 2003, I established the role that statistical process control charts (specifically log likelihood CUSUM charts), and other routinely collected data (from death certificates) could play in the continuous surveillance of healthcare outcomes, and in this specific case, the detection of unusual patterns of patient mortality within General Practices.  I have demonstrated comparable (or better) coverage and completeness of routinely collected administrative data compared to clinical audit data. I have also demonstrated the strength of risk prediction models based on hospital administrative data compared to clinical data. I have developed indicators of healthcare performance based on hospital mortality patient safety indicators,and more recently stroke care and returns to theatre. I have also led the development of a national surveillance tool, the Real-Time Monitoring System (RTM as it is known), designed to monitor hospital outcomes across a range of diagnosis and procedure groups in near real time with data updated monthly. More recent research carried out by the unit since 2007 has refined this system, setting thresholds based on false alarm rates within CUSUM charts for multiple institutions, the automation of multiple risk adjustment models, the incorporation of hierarchical modelling techniques, the refinement of co-morbidity indices and the development of new indicators with potentially greater sensitivity than mortality. Other work on out of hours healthcare outcomes, most recently my work on elective procedures and mortality by day of the week have resulted in policy changes towards increasing clinical cover at weekends within the NHS.",

      "Dr Abel is a Senior Lecturer in Musculoskeletal Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College London. He is a PI in the Musculoskeletal laboratory (MSk) where he leads the Bone Health Group supervising a multidisciplinary team of clinical and non-clinical scientists. Richie has authored more than 60 journal articles and book chapters, that have been cited over 2700 times (H-Index 31). Richie is the co-creator and co-host of the BoneUp podcast which aims to empower people living with bone disease and their families. The podcast received the 2022 Neil Mackenzie Public Engagement Award from the Bone Research Society.",
      " ",
      "Richie’s research pursues the evidence base for healthcare and environmental policy. His primary goals are to discover the mechanisms behind the remarkable mechanical properties of bone and better understand how ageing and environmental factors, like environmental pollution, modulate the response to mechanical loading, predisposing bones to osteoporotic fracture from the molecular scale up. Then apply the knowledge and evidence base to improve policy, diagnostics, and interventions for bone disease.",
      " ",
      "His technical innovations have resulted in new methods for studying tissue and organ mechanics from the molecular scale-up. His work included introducing synchrotron imaging methods to bone health research in humans. He combines synchrotron X-ray imaging techniques with microscopy and atomistic molecular dynamic modelling to determine the molecular and nanoscale mechanisms responsible for altering higher-scale mechanical properties in bone. Riche applies the methods to study the mechanisms underlying the effects of ageing and the environment on bone health and disease.",
      "Richie is translating the research by testing the application of bone health measures for clinical decision-making in surgery of the hip and spine. His work also includes the introduction of novel diagnostic and screening technologies in healthcare to improve the identification and treatment of osteoporosis. Richie works with companies developing healthcare technologies (e.g., X-ray and ultrasound) by supporting the design and delivery of preclinical and clinical trials. Richie also studies the natural history of bone stress injuries in dancers (ballet and contemporary) to improve the health and well-being of dancers and develop decision-making around ceasing and then returning to play.",
      "Richie is a JBMR Plus Editorial Board (2022-2024) and has served on numerous committees and working groups supporting research and translation including the Royal Osteoporosis Society (Cure Advisory Group, Technology Academy), The Diamond Light (K11 DIAD beamline), the British Orthopaedic Society (Secretary). He chaired the organising committee of the British Orthopaedic Society (2018) and sits on the Royal Osteoporosis Society Conference Committee (2023).",
      "Richie is well-known for his research investigating why some people age healthily whilst others sustain osteoporotic fractures. Their milestone papers are published in Scientific Reports (, ) and were featured on BBC Radio, ToDay programme 1/3/2017, Inside Health programme 14/3/2017, Guardian 13/3/2017, and Daily Mail 27/8/20. The work provided unique insight as it addressed bone mechanics at a near-molecular scale enabled by synchrotron diffraction experiments. The group is one of only a handful worldwide with demonstrated expertise to carry out these unique experiments. Publishing an invited review on the clinical importance of molecular bone mechanics in Current Osteoporosis Reports ().",
      "This research was funded by The Royal Osteoporosis Society, the Wellcome Trust Accelerator Award, and donations from Michael Uren Foundation and The Doctor Mortimer & Teresa Sackler Foundation.

For the first time in history, the computerization of government and the availability of alternative data sources like satellite imagery and private firm data make it possible to study the process of economic development at high resolution. We believe that economic opportunity is often a highly local phenomenon: children only benefit from nearby schools, and workers in a location can only access jobs within commuting range. We have spent the last decade assembling a wide range of economic data on every village and town in India (N=600,000): living standards, firms, infrastructure, agricultural productivity, etc. This is the basis of much of my research, but we have also made it publicly available through the SHRUG open data platform, which has been downloaded over 15,000 times to date.

      "With a longstanding interest in epigenetics and chromatin biology, Dr. Shuchi Agrawal-Singh’s research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer originating from white blood cells of the myeloid lineage. AML is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and blocked differentiation. Agrawal-Singh’s lab is interested in investigating how mutations in epigenetic modulators leads to dysregulated “epigenetic language” driving abnormal- gene transcription, chromatin organisation and impact biomolecular condensation in leukemogenesis, with the aim of implementing these discoveries for the development of novel epigenetic therapies. ",
      "Dr. Agrawal Singh received her PhD in Biology (Molecular Haematology/Oncology) from University of Muenster, Germany. Her work was amongst the earlier studies that defined the importance of DNA-promoter-hypermethylation in silencing tumour suppressor genes in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and to use it as potential MRD-biomarker for predicting relapse risk in AML patients. She received an outstanding PhD with 3 first author and 4 co-authored publications. Moving on with independent postdoctoral fellowship from Danish Research Council (FSS), she joined BRIC (Copenhagen University) for postdoctoral training. Her work at BRIC, demonstrated the dynamic role of Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) in regulating the lineage specific enhancer and transcriptional control during human-mesenchymal stem-cells differentiation. Further her research continued at University of Cambridge, probing the molecular epigenetic mechanisms underlying AML pathogenesis and her work revealed a novel function of transcription factor HOXA9 as transcriptional repressor required to prevent differentiation in AML. ",
      "Since November 2024, Dr. Agrawal-Singh joined Imperial College London as non-clinical lecturer. She is the founder and co-organizer of the Cancer Chromatin & Epigenetics Club (CCEC), virtual monthly seminar series, run jointly with Imperial College and University of Cambridge. CCEC is globally leading online seminar series with 400-600 attendees each seminar, free educational and networking platform. https://www.haem.cam.ac.uk/events/cancer-chromatin-and-epigenetics-club"

One of these, the more agressive, is currently spreading steadily through the main cocoa-growing areas and is of great concern. In the other project Ansar Ali is studying the range of cultural characteristics of isolates of Rhizoctonia found on rice in Bangladesh, as a prelude to molecular fingerprinting of the isolates and comparison of their relative pathogenicity.",

      "Two linked projects on the mycotoxin patulin are currently in progress. Established work on the physiology of the main producer, Penicillium expansum, growing post-harvest on stored apple, is being supported by a new study examining field factors that might explain the relative preponderance of patulin 'outbreaks' on some farms compared with others. The Silwood Park orchard, an environment unsprayed for many years is being used to establish baseline ecological information on pathogen abundance and habitat.",

      "Plant pathologists continue to make an input to the work of the environmental pollution group, Julie Beare finished her studies on the interactions between Melampsora and Marsonnina leaf diseases of poplar and the incidence of ozone pollution. Meanwhile, Nic Jarraud is examining a parallel system, that of tar spot of sycamore, but this time including aphid infestation in a four member interaction. Human interference seems to have influenced distribution of this disease in unpredictable ways and current gaseous pollutants are but one and probably not dominant factor."

This work was based at the Queen Mary University of London Preventive Neurology Unit, supervised by Prof Alastair Noyce.",

      "Dr. Suhaib Ardah is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Tribology Group at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London. His research focuses on the development of advanced numerical tools to achieve a comprehensive understanding of fluid-solid interactions across multiple spatio-temporal scales, ranging from macroscopic to microscopic levels.",
      "",
      "Dr. Ardah is currently a member of the prestigious 5-year EPSRC-funded collaboration between Imperial College London, Shell, and Diamond Light Source (InFUSE Prosperity Partnership). This initiative is dedicated to advancing the transition to net-zero emissions by deepening our understanding of interface behaviours through a multidisciplinary approach that investigates morphology, structure and chemistry across scales, from the atomic to the macroscale and under extreme operational conditions. His role focuses on developing novel computational modelling techniques designed to bridge the gap between different scales, ergo linking atomic-level phenomena with macroscopic behaviours and offering critical insights that inform the design and optimisation of sustainable engineering solutions.",
      "",
      "Dr. Ardah completed his PhD in the Tribology Group at Imperial College London under the supervision of Professor Daniele Dini and Dr. Tom Reddyhoff, in collaboration with Dr. Francisco J. Profito from the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo. His research focused on developing a fully coupled Reynolds-based computational framework for analysing various lubricated systems. The framework integrates the generalised Reynolds equation, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, with the thermal energy equation using mass-conserving finite volume schemes, enabling the study of complex interactions such as hydrodynamic effects, lubricant rheology and interfacial heat generation. Collaborating closely with experimentalists, Dr. Ardah aligned his theoretical models with experimental data to enhance their practical applicability. His work also involved collaborations with industrial partners such as Safran, SKF, Shell and P&G.",
      "",
      "Prior to joining Imperial College in 2019, he achieved his MEng degree in Mechanical Engineering (First Class Hons.) at Cardiff University in 2019 under the guidance of Professor H.P. (Pwt) Evans, a renowned expert in the field of tribology. His work focused on evaluating how temperature variations influence the behaviour of lubricated interfaces under elliptical contact conditions by implementing numerical models capable of providing valuable insights into the interplay between heat generation and fluid dynamics.",

      "Véronique is originally from Paris where she obtained her PhD for work on the molecular genetics of lymphocyte development at the Institute Pasteur (Department of Immunology). She then crossed the channel and joined the MRC London Laboratory of Medical Sciences in the group of Professor Dame Amanda Fisher. Here, she explored as an MRC Postdoctoral Fellow how chromatin ‘shutdown’ contributes to lineage restriction and maintenance of cell fate identity through development. Notably, her work in embryonic stem cells, among others, pioneered the discovery that many inactive developmental regulators carry bivalent chromatin structure being enriched for repressive marks and indicators of active chromatin. This bivalent marking is proposed to prime lineage-specifying genes for future activation yet prevent their premature expression through Polycomb-mediated repression. ",
      " ",
      "In 2006 Véronique started her independent research group at the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology (IRDB) of Imperial College London supported by an MRC Collaborative Career Development Award in Stem Cells and a BBSRC New Investigator Award. Her group has since focussed on understanding how cell potency and differentiation are balanced in stem cells and in the developing mammalian embryo. In the early embryo, this implies unravelling how cell heterogeneity arises, how pluripotency is achieved and safeguarded while promoting the formation of essential extra-embryonic lineages, and how the pluripotent embryonic tissue itself is remodelled upon implantation in preparation for all subsequent differentiation events and foetal growth. Combining in vivo studies with embryo stem cell models, her group pursues a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach to address these questions from transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic perspectives. Most recently, her group uncovered a previously unrecognized link between lipid metabolism and the morphogenesis of pluripotent stem cell progenitors during peri-implantation development, with a specific focus on lipid droplet biology. ",
      " ",
      "Throughout her journey, Véronique grew an active interest in developing others as the mother of two daughters, a caring research group leader and mentor, teaching module leads and tutor, a university-wise champion for early career researchers as well as acting as departmental lead in research culture/Athena Swan. In 2024, she was awarded an Imperial President’s Medal for Excellence in Research Environment (Ethics, Culture, and Sustainability).",

      "in the field of attosecond physics. I study fundamental ultrafast electronic processes that occur in molecules and clusters following excitation and/or ionisation, for example by a laser pulse. These electronic transitions, such as Auger decay, interatomic (intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) and others, are driven by electron-electron interaction and are the basic manifestation of the electron correlation in nature. They are of high practical importance for estimation and understanding of the radiation damage done by high-frequency radiation. My group is developing and using first principles many-electron theoretical methods to investigate the complex dynamics of the known electronic rearrangements and to predict new physical phenomena of this type. The ab initio computational method developed in my group recently, B-spline algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), allows us to look inside the radiative and non-radiative many-electron transitions in order to study the onset and the effect of quantum coherence on these phenomena.",

In 2018, he was honoured by the World Energy Council with a certificate of appreciation for his dedicated leadership as a board member of Future Energy Leaders.",
      "",
      "Throughout his career, Dr. Alshammari has taught more than 1500 students in Saudi Arabia and in the UK who were recruited by leading energy firms, including Aramco, SLB, Halliburton, and NEOM. Between 2023 and 2025, he served as a distinguished judge at the Oil & Gas Middle East Awards, where he evaluated the sustainability and decarbonisation of numerous multi-billion-dollar projects and talented individuals from leading energy firms across the region. Currently, Dr. Alshammari is the President of the London College of Energy Economics, a new think tank and learning affiliate of the Energy Institute, with a mission to deliver policy-oriented research and train the next generation of energy leaders for a sustainable energy future."

      "My research focuses on developing methods to analyze radio astronomy data using tools from rough path theory. Rough path models have the potential to help the development of measurement instruments and processing techniques used in new telescopes. Collaborating with the new SKA telescope and Cambridge, our aim is to improve detection sensitivity and focus on EoR signals.",

      "Before arriving at Imperial College, I completed my PhD in experimental particle physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). I primarily analyzed data taken with the ATLAS detector at CERN in the search for Dark Matter. I collaborated on developing models that applied machine learning techniques to improve our results.",
