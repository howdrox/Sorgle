      "Hydrogen interaction in metal can be both advantageous and catastrophic. Hydrogen is beneficially used in the direct reduction of iron. The steel making industry accounts for 8% of worldwide CO2 emissions, and to achieve low carbon goals by 2050, alternative extraction methods must be developed. Traditional blast furnace techniques have an energy consumption of 19.8 GJ/t, yet direct reduction via hydrogen based low temperature electrolysis reduces this to 13 GJ/t. By developing corrosion resistant electrode materials for direct reduction via the understanding of hydrogen in this process, my group is increasing resilience in the UK steel supply chain, whilst contributing to the global responsibility of reducing CO2 emissions.

The fundamental effects of hydrogen in materials such as zirconium and titanium are not fully understood. Hydrogen transport and storage in renewable technologies has a need for protection against hydrogen embrittlement to prevent catastrophic failure. In detecting, measuring, and tracking hydrogen in these materials, a deeper understanding of current embrittlement theories can be formed. ",

His research focuses on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), their multidisciplinary applications in long-term climate change mitigation scenarios, and data analytics to explore mitigation strategies. Alaa's interest encompasses various mitigation approaches, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures. Alaa is recently focused on exploring the impacts of disruptive events (socioeconomic, technological, or environmental) on long-term mitigation scenarios using IAMs. His interest in scenarios data analytics covers decomposition methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering techniques, and vetting of scenarios data. Alaa is also interested in applications of models' linking, and currently exploring role of finance sector dynamics in IAMs. Drawing from his past experience with the IPCC, Alaa has broader interests including enhancing climate change assessments by promoting FAIR data principles and carefully leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to augment scientific assessment processes.",

      "Alaa has been a Research Fellow at Imperial College London since 2019. During the first three years of his fellowship, he served as a full-time Senior Scientist at the Technical Support Unit of Working Group III (WGIII - Climate Mitigation) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He supported the production of the 6th Assessment Report (AR6), where he is also a Contributing Author. His contributions to the assessment were focused on topics related to integrated assessment modelling, and the assessment of long-term mitigation scenarios. He also served as an Ex-Officio Member of the IPCC’s Task Group on Data Support for Climate Change Assessments (TG-Data). Alaa contributed to the AR6 Scenarios Database international outreach activities and supported international processes at UNFCCC and SBSTA (such as the Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement) in communicating the results of the WGIII assessment report. Given Alaa’s involvement in AR6, he was recently selected to join the IPCC team, which met Members of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to provide scientific insights in preparation for the case on ‘obligations of States in respect of climate change’, following the United Nations General Assembly resolution 77/276.",

      "The polyester ligament system was then engineered for human use, including extensive fatigue-creep testing, in collaboration with DePuy Ltd and DuPont Ltd. A multi-centre clinical trial was set up, with particular collaboration with Mr Sadhan Mukherjee, of Airdrie Hospital, who introduced arthroscopic methods.",
      "",
      "Although artificial ligaments fell out of use, the work on the stability of the knee continued, with early work examining the roles of fibre bundles within the cruciate ligaments; that led to development of double-bundle ligament reconstruction methods which gave a closer approximation of natural knee laxity behaviour. This led to membership of both the Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligament Study Groups, and Andrew was the inaugural International Research Professor of the ACL Study Group in 2003.",

      "Dr Andrew Ashley’s research interests pivot around the catalytic activation of dihydrogen into proton and hydride equivalents, in order to bring about a step change in the reactivity of the hydrogen molecule with reducible substrates. Systems capable of such a transformation are the recently discovered ‘Frustrated Lewis Pairs’ (FLPs) which are based on non-metal components such as amines and Lewis acidic boranes. In conjunction with efforts to design new thermally and hydrolytically stable FLPs, novel metal-based systems capable of effecting the reversible splitting of hydrogen are also being investigated. The primary goal is then to effect the hydrogenation of important small molecules (which are coordinated to transition metal based co-catalysts), mediated by sequential ‘proton coupled hydride transfer’ using activated hydrogen. Since hydrogen can be synthesised from the splitting of water using renewable solar energy we can obtain routes to the chemical storage of hydrogen and thus energy.",

      "Hydrogenation of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide into hydrocarbons and water.  ",
      "In the case of carbon monoxide this is known as the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and is currently performed heterogeneously and at elevated temperatures and pressures; it generally exhibits poor selectivity. Since carbon monoxide can be made through the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (albeit endothermically), conducting this reaction in parallel with a homogeneous FT reaction (strongly exothermic) would enable the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons for use as carbon-neutral ‘green’ fuels, or feedstock chemicals (carbon sequestration). Such co-catalysts are based on mid-late transition metals of the 1st and 2nd row.",

      "Fixation of dinitrogen to ammonia.  ",
      "The Haber process produces all synthetic ammonia from dihydrogen and dinitrogen that humans use for fertiliser to improve agricultural yields and hence help feed the world population. However, it does so at an immense energy cost (ca. 2% global energy demand) due to operation at high temperatures and pressure. Since iron is used in this process, and an iron-only nitrogenase has been discovered in Nature, co-catalytic dinitrogen iron(II) complexes are the focus of this research to devise a pathway for nitrogen hydrogenation at ambient temperatures and pressure.",
      " ",
      "Many aspects of these transformations are applicable to an industrial context, where reactions are often conducted at high temperatures. Accordingly the design of new thermally robust ligands and their coordination complexes is an important aspect of our current methodology. All targets are homogeneous systems which are amenable to study using conventional techniques (e.g. NMR and IR spectroscopy) and thus offer the benefit of improving product selectivity through rational ligand modification."

      "My research group is interested in a variety of topics related to the vertebrate craniofacial (head) development, craniofacial genetic conditions in humans and craniofacial developmental evolution. We use morphometric, molecular, cellular and genetic approaches to study the precise mechanisms of cranial skeletal cell differentiation and skull/face morphogenesis in amniotes. The species we work with range from the laboratory \"model\" systems, such as chicken embryos and mouse mutants, to the \"non-model\" species used for evolutionary developmental studies, for example, Darwin's Finches and their relatives from Caribbean Islands, as well as other birds and, more recently, reptiles, both squamates (e.g. Anolis lizards), and archosaurs, such as alligators. This combination of laboratory \"model\" species with \"non-model\" species from natural environments allows us to address important conceptual questions, such as the roles of particular developmental genetic mechanisms (e.g. modularity) in evolution of adaptive variation and significant morphological transitions at both small and large evolutionary scales.",
      " ",
      "Generally, our studies on evolutionary developmental biology (Evo-Devo) have a tripartite structure of the overall approach: 1) The first step is quantification of morphological variation using methods ranging from simply scoring the absence or presence of particular structures to 3D imaging and modeling; 2) The second component is identification of candidate genetic and developmental mechanisms using methods ranging from observations of the trait as it emerges in real time to quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to microarray and RNAseq screens;3) The third part is functional assays of candidate genes/pathways to reveal the more causative relationships by methods ranging from physical manipulations to tissue and embryo transgenesis with molecular vectors.",

His research combines aspect of materials science, nanotechnology, and biology to develop methods for dynamically manipulating the behaviour of cells and tissues. A major focus of this research is to understand how to direct the process of tissue repair by manipulating signalling networks. These insights are then used to develop methods for healing diabetic foot ulcers, preventing hypertrophic scarring, and modulating other wound healing disorders. More information can be found on the lab website.",

While at Stanford, Dr Almquist was also appointed as a Research Fellow in the Center for Probing the Nanoscale, a joint venture between Stanford, IBM, and the National Science Foundation. There he developed a bioinspired approach for integrating inorganic nanostructures with cellular membranes. Dr Almquist then went on to become an NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Postdoctoral Fellow at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Solider Nanotechnologies at MIT, where his research focused on designing self-assembled biomaterials for modulating the healing of chronic wounds.",

Just as conditional probability is one of the pillars of modern probability, conditional independence is critical in statistical modelling. It underlies model specification, and allows us to infer, elicit, and understand correlation structures between unobserved variables, given the value s of variables we already know.

Her research is focused on multiscale process and molecular/materials design, including the development of design methods, property prediction techniques and optimisation algorithms.

      "Dr Adjiman's group brings molecular-level decisions into process design through fundamental advances in modelling and optimisation methods, and follows this through to implementation and application.",
      " ",
      "In designing new processes e.g., chemical processes, energy conversion devices – the molecules or materials required for processing (such as solvents or catalysts) are often chosen first. This is usually done from a limited set of choices (or design space) because evaluating many options, computationally or experimentally, is costly and time-consuming. Once this choice is made, the process topology and operating conditions can be chosen. This sequential decision making can lead to poor performance as it limits the design space and it ignores the intrinsic links between molecules and process. A simple question such as what is the best solvent for a reaction in a pharmaceutical manufacturing process cannot be answered in isolation. The answer depends on the reactor temperature and pressure, and on what follows in the process. If it is another reaction, it may be best to find a single solvent that works reasonably well for both reactions, to avoid expensive steps such as “swapping” one solvent for another, which often requires an energy-intensive separation.",
      " ",
      "By extending the boundary of process design to include molecular or material level decisions, real benefits can be accrued: better process economics, and lower environmental impact through increased material and energy efficiency. Further, by using optimisation to pose and solve extended design problems, the explicit evaluation of every design is avoided, making it possible to consider large design spaces: thousands of molecules, countless mixtures, wide temperature/pressure ranges, unusual process topologies. A few promising designs can be assessed experimentally to verify the results of model-based design. This general methodology, integrated molecular and process design, has been singled out for its potential to enhance innovation and competitiveness.",

(i) To present the basic ethical frameworks used in current approaches to ethics in AI, the methods used in designing artificial agents which conform to instances of such frameworks, and to equip the students with the skills of analysis needed to reason about ethical dilemmas in AI. (ii) To present ways of measuring and preventing biased decision making by ML models, and the accuracy/fairness trade-off; to give students the practical tools to define and measure the fairness of ML algorithms. (iii) To present the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its impact on AI that involves personal data, as a key illustrative example of an important law affecting AI/ML, given the risk of large potential fines/compensation claims under the GDPR in practice; other selected laws (e.g., on anti-discrimination) will also be highlighted.\"",

      "I am a lecturer in the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College London, where I lead the Computational Astrodynamics (COAST) research group. Prior to joining Imperial, I was a Postdoctoral Associate first at the University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ, USA) and subsequently at the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research of the University of Colorado (Boulder, CO, USA). I completed my doctoral studies at the Technical University of Madrid (Spain) in 2017 while working as an Early Stage Researcher in the Stardust Marie Curie Initial Training Network. I obtained a MSc (2013) and BSc (2009) from the University of Naples \"Federico II\" (Italy), both in Aerospace Engineering.",
      " ",
      "My research area is astrodynamics. Specifically, my group develops advanced computational methods to enhance the understanding and prediction of space activities. We address challenges in space situational awareness, contributing to the safety, security, and sustainability of space operations by preventing potential hazards such as in-space collisions.",
      "Our methods enable the robust estimation, inference, and prediction of satellite dynamics from observations by exploiting advanced concepts in applied mathematics. These include fast orbit propagation methods with known error bounds, the characterisation and minimisation of errors in space catalogue data, and the reconstruction of satellite manoeuvres and physical characteristics through scientific machine learning.",

      "Elia is a human geographer and political ecologist whose research interrogates the contested geographies and political ecologies of infrastructure, urbanisation and social-environmental justice. Her work is primarily organised around three interrelated strands: first, the transformative power of infrastructure projects and neoliberal environmental and planning policies in reshaping spaces, socionatures, and everyday livelihoods; second, the uneven and often unjust effects of these transformations on communities along lines of class, gender, and ethnicity; and third, the emancipatory potential of grassroots activism and community struggles in advancing alternative pathways toward social-environmental sustainability and justice.",
      "",
      "Between 2012 and 2022, Elia held postdoctoral and lectureship positions at leading academic institutions, including the Department of Geography and the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership at the University of Cambridge (2012-2022), and the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford (2016-2017). She has also held visiting fellowships at the Center for Place, Culture, and Politics at City University of New York (2016) and the Rachel Caron Center at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich (2017). From 2022 to 2024, she was based at ICTA, Autonomous University of Barcelona, as a Senior Researcher, where she co-led a new research line on planetary urban infrastructures at the Barcelona Lab for Urban Environmental Sustainability and Justice. She has also been a Fellow at both Trinity College and Churchill College at the University of Cambridge where she remains an alumna.",
      "",
      "Elia's work has been recognised through numerous prestigious fellowships and competitive research grants. These include an individual Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship (awarded with a score of 98/100), the Carson Fellowship, a Ramon y Cajal Fellowship (ranking 1st in Spain with a score of 99/100), and funding form major national and European schemes, including FP7, Horizon2020, COST, the British Academy, Cambridge Arts Humanities & Social Sciences, and the Royal Geographical Society.",

      "Fater Akuhwa is a PhD student in the Control and Power group, department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. His PhD research under the supervision of Professor Timothy Charles Green and Professor Mark O'Malley focuses on proposing trade-offs in grid and IBR co-design for the provision of system services in the 100% renewable electricity grid. System services were previously provided by synchronous generators and tied to their inherent characteristics. A choice therefore exists between modification of inverters to provide those services or enhancement of the grid in some way as to use less or different services. Rather than this being a strict choice between two options, it should be viewed as striking a compromise somewhere between these options to find the least cost solution. The current phase of his research explores how mechanisms to ensure less angle deviation between resources and well-chosen \"mho\" regions in protection relays can achieve high levels of selectivity without needing to increase current fault levels through additional hardware. ",

      "In November 2023 he was part of a delegation from Imperial College London that participated in the Global Fellows Program held in Kigali Rwanda, in partnership with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), an opportunity provided to PhD researchers to further develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in an interdisciplinary context. From May - August 2024, he visited the University of Toronto as a recipient of Imperial's Turing Award to conduct research related to protection of power systems with a high penetration of inverter-based resources. Fater serves as a Graduate Teaching Assistant in various modules including Mathematics for Engineers, Topics in Electrical Engineering, and Power Systems and Power Electronics."

The  pH regulatory system controls expression of genes involved in  metabolite (eg toxins and antibiotics) export, extracellular enzymes and  nutrient uptake and its functioning is crucial for fungal infections of  both plants and animals.  The calcium project originated  from the identification of a novel mutational combination which results  in strains requiring high levels of calcium for growth and an indicator  activity which reflects calcium status.

      "His current global prowess as an iconic contributor to medical innovations on neonatology in the world has been greatly influenced by his academic exploits, both as a student and later staff/Professor at the prestigious Imperial College London, United Kingdom. During this period, he had been celebrated in innovation and discoveries across medical disciplines as: (1) The discovery of the mathematical model that relates the capsular-insertion neck of the human proximal humerus to its anatomical neck in 2006; a discovery that enhanced the development of modern predictive tools for the planning of shoulder surgeries (2) The innovation of Recycled Incubator Technology (RIT) for neonatal incubator interventions in 2003 (3) The discovery of tropical Evening-fever Syndrome (EFS) in the neonate in 2012 and its antidote against neonatal hyperthermia in 2014 (4) The innovation of the Handy Approach (HHA) in 2012 and the Initial set-point algorithm (HISA) in 2016 for interventions against high neonatal mortality orchestrated by high incidence of neonatal thermal stress in low and middle-income countries (5) The innovation of Politeheart ventilator - a bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device in 2017 (6) The innovation of Polite-oxygen supply splitter system -the PSS - in 2019 (7) The invention of Polite02Blend in 2019 - an oxygen-air blender system for neonatal respiratory support, etc.",
      " ",
      "His current practice spanned across the entire regions of Nigeria, reaching over 30 tertiary hospitals, in the last two decades. He has since been a regular in the WHO and World Bank list of global thinkers on impact of climate change on neonatal health from the African perspective. His Nigerian research group members are located at hospitals across the entire geopolitical zones of Nigeria; enabling him an unprecedented access to evidence based data on a national representative scale [http://neonatalconcerns.org]. He has led these groups to devise globally applaudable medical procedures and devices, with much global recognition, including the Fellowship of the Royal Society of Medicine (FRSM).",
      " ",
      "His present role at Imperial College London focuses on Frugal Medical Technology for low- and middle-income countries. This runs alongside his position of PRINCIPAL consultant at Neonatal Concerns for Africa charity organisation."

      "Dr Holger Auner received his MD from Karl-Franzens University Graz, Austria, where he also trained in Internal Medicine/Haematology-Oncology and studied genetic instability in myeloid leukaemias in the laboratory of Professor Heinz Sill. He then joined the group of Professor Niall Dillon at the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre as a Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund Junior Research Fellow and obtained his PhD for work on plasma cell biology from Imperial College London. Subsequently, he was the Stem Cell Transplant Co-ordinator in the Centre for Haematology at Hammersmith Hospital. He was awarded a Cancer Research UK Clinician Scientist Fellowship in 2012 and a Cancer Research UK Advanced Clinician Scientist Fellowship in 2019, when he became Head of Translational Research at Imperial's newly established Hugh and Josseline Langmuir Centre for Myeloma Research. In 2022, Dr Auner became Professor of Clinical and Molecular Haemato-oncology at Imperial College. Dr Auner’s primary research interest is to better understand the molecular mechanisms that coordinate protein degradation pathways with cellular metabolism in multiple myeloma and other cancers, with the ultimate goal of finding novel therapeutic approaches. His lab, the Cancer Cell Protein Metabolism group, also investigates how proteomic and metabolic homeostasis depend on tissue physical properties and vice versa, using time-resolved omics approaches in a range of cross-disciplinary collaborations. Dr Auner is an active member of the European Myeloma Network (EMN), was Principal Investigator for Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust for several phase 1 to 3 national and international trials, and Translational Research Lead of the UK Myeloma Research Alliance (2020 - 2023). In April 2023, he became Head of the Hematology service and central hematology laboratory at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Full Professor at the University of Lausanne.  ",

      "I got my PhD degree from the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department at Imperial College London. My research is mainly focused on the interaction of gas/hydrogen and electricity systems from operation and planning perspectives. In this context, the modelling is carried out for e.g., GB energy system in 2030 and 2050, where a significant part of the heat and transport sector should be electrified. Furthermore, cost-effective transition to a lower-carbon energy system achieved by the employment of flexibility options (i.e., demand side response, electricity storage, flexible gas plants, multi-directional compressors, and interconnections) in the integrated operation and planning of different energy vectors (mainly gas/hydrogen, heat and electricity) is investigated. I was a Co-Investigator in the \"Whole system analysis of advanced thermal energy storage technologies in future UK energy networks\"  project. I am a Contributing Author in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) WG 3 and contributed to many scientific papers as well as research projects related to the energy industry, such as projects for the Committee of Climate Change (CCC) and Ofgem."

      "Jane Apperley qualified in Medicine from the University of Birmingham in 1979 and completed specialist training in haematology in Birmingham, London and Cambridge. Throughout this time she developed an interest in stem cell transplantation (SCT), and by default in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), which was the primary indication for SCT in the 1990s. She spent two years as a post-doctoral fellow at the Children’s Hospital in Boston, USA, training in gene transfer and therapy. She returned to the Hammersmith Hospital in 1993, was given a personal chair in Haemato-Oncology in 2002, and became the Clinical Director for Clinical Haematology at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, and the Chair of the Centre of Haematology at the Imperial College in 2003/4. She stepped down from both posts in 2021. In 2022 she was appointed to the position of Campus Director for the Hammersmith-White City Campus of Imperial College.",
      " ",
      "Professor Apperley has occupied international leadership positions including Presidencies of the British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT), the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and the Joint Accreditation Committee of EISCT and EBMT (JACIE). She has reviewed national and international grant awards including acting as Chair of the European Research Council ‘Starting Investigators’ program. ",
      "",
      "Her interests remain the biology and management of CML, and her group at the Imperial College has extensive experience in the use of first, second and third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly in the areas of molecular monitoring, mechanisms of drug resistance and adverse events. She has a long-standing interest in the impact of haematological diseases and their treatment on fertility, pregnancy and foetal outcome. She has been a member of the ELN CML Working Party since the creation of the ELN in 2004 and has been involved with the ELN Consensus Guidelines since the first recommendations in 2006, initially as the ‘expert’ in SCT but will now lead the next version of the guidelines, with a predicted publication date of 2024."

A Neurologist and Neuropathologist by training, he previously worked at the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics at Oxford. He’s research focused on genetically-defined forms of PD, the use of human genomic constructs for animal and in vitro functional modelling and autophagy. He has pioneered the development of novel tools to detect in situ early protein aggregates such as alpha-synuclein oligomers in human brain and a novel assay to visualise seeding activity in situ. He is applying these tools to the dissection of the initial pathogenic processes in PD and Alzheimer’s disease, including gene expression pathway alterations linked to the earliest pathological events. He has led a study that has provided a new staging system for the neuropathology of PD incorporating glial alongside neuronal pathology. He directs the provision of  Neuropathology for the MS & PD Tissue Bank at the College as well as for academic and clinical colleagues and tissue users and he leads a research portfolio centred on the Tissue Bank specimens. He is looking forward to meeting colleagues from different disciplines interested in developing novel and exciting ideas to use human tissue for research."

Her clinical interests include acute respiratory infection, acute lung injury and the role of ultrasound in critical care.",
      "",
      "Joana started her PhD in July 2014 under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Hind, Dr. Charlotte Dean and Dr. Mark Griffiths. Her focus of research is on lung injury and repair pathways in human models based on ex vivo lung perfusion technology (EVLP) using a human precision lung cut slice model. She is also looking to explore how specific pathways important in embryonic development, such as retinoic acid metabolism (RA), have the potential induce regeneration of the human lung. It has been demonstrated that the lung has a far greater degree of plasticity than previously thought and that molecules such as RA might be used to prevent deterioration, promote direct repair or even tissue regeneration. This could lead to the development of disease-modifying therapies that can repair and restore lung function in diseases such as emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and ARDS."

John has worked predominantly within the Pharmaceutical Industry, specialising in respiratory physiology and pharmacology, and has focused primarily on novel drug discovery. With about '40' years in the business (26 years at the Wellcome Research Laboratories, 6 years as Co-founder, Director and Chairman of Pneumolabs (UK) Ltd and 8 years at Pfizer), his recognised expertise in sensory neuropharmacology, particularly in airway disease (including asthma, COPD and chronic cough), led to over 30 peer-reviewed publications and invited presentations.  During his time in industry, John has been involved with managing teams of research scientists, identifying and developing novel targets for drug discovery, influencing Clinical Project Investigations as well as producing expert reports for marketing. John has extensive experience and worked on many potential novel therapeutic agents for lung disease including bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory and sensory nerve targets. Throughout his time in the industry, John also took great pleasure in lecturing/supervising undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students as well as examining PhD candidates. He was elected a Fellow of the British Pharmacological Society in 2013. ",

      "Mitochondria perform several critical functions including cellular energy production and initiation of cellular apoptosis. Resistance to mitochondrial cell death is one of the main features of cancer cells and mitochondrial dysfunction, including changes in the structural integrity of mitochondria, disruption of energy metabolism and abnormal calcium (Ca2 ) buffering, has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. The current scientific interests of Dr. Alavian’s group include the study of basic molecular mechanisms leading to such dysfunctions and translation of these findings to novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative conditions and cancer."

      "I manage the NIHR BRC Brain Sciences Theme at Imperial College London and I assist the Theme Lead with the strategic coordination of the broad range of research projects and initiatives conducted within the Theme. The research conducted within our Theme focusses on improving our understanding of the role of inflammatory mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and stroke. In addition, the research capabilities of the Theme have been expanded and strengthened with the research work carried out on prevention, assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders, particularly those linked with emotional dysregulation. It is a privilege for me to support a team of world-class scientists to discover disease mechanisms and risk factors that underpin new diagnostics and therapies for all those conditions.",

I hold a PhD in Psychology and in my research work I explored the cognitive and anatomical correlates of neglect for peripersonal (near) and extrapersonal (far) space. In my subsequent research positions, I conducted multicentre clinical trials with neurological and psychiatric patients from study set-up to closure. In addition, I carried out a randomised controlled trial of a quality improvement network for low-secure forensic mental health services to examine the impact of network membership on the process and outcomes of care.",

Through out those years I worked in projects relating to acute myeloid leukaemia, breast cancer, and sequencing-based methods and data.",

      "In 2022 I joined Imperial College London as part of the MultiSci MRC DTP programme. In my first year in the programme I further explored my interests as part of the MRes in Biomedical Research (Data Science). During this time, I worked on projects focusing on the biological processes leading to relapse in ER breast cancer, exploring epigenomics and unsupervised learning approaches along with my supervisors Prof Luca Magnani and Dr Barbara Bravi. These MRes projects turned into my current PhD project supervised by the aforementioned principal investigators in addition to Dr Marina Evangelou. My project focuses on the testing and development of novel statistical methods for the mutli-omic integration of sequencing-based datasets in the context of ER breast cancer evolution, and it is done in collaboration with the Institute of Cancer Research."

      "Our research is focused on, Gram negative bacterial secretion systems, regulation, biofilm formation factors, antimicrobial resistance and virulence of pathogens. Secretion systems enable bacteria to export proteins into the environment or directly into host cells or rival bacteria. These systems play a role in enabling the bacteria to subvert the host, obtain nutrients and compete with other bacteria in a particular environment. A biofilm is a community of bacteria growing within a self-produced matrix. Biofilms are a challenge for medicine because they are less susceptible to antibiotics, phage, detergents and the host immune system. How bacteria sense and deploy secretion systems, biofilm programs and other factors to prosper in response to their environmental challenges fascinates us. We are happy to support competitive and eligible PhD candidates for the Presidents Scholarships and can also explore other options for funding. My team has obtained funding from ESCMID, Academy of Medical Sciences, BBSRC, LifeArc and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.",

      "I gained my Bachelor of Science with first class Honours from The University of Queensland in 2006. In 2007 I was awarded an Australian Postgraduate Award (APA) and commenced my PhD at The University of Queensland in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences. There I focused on the characterization of new adhesins in uropathogenic Escherichia coli for their role in biofilm formation, adhesion and virulence. In 2013 I joined the research group of Professor Alain Filloux at the MRC Centre for Bacteriology and Infection at Imperial College and I switched to focus on the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 2014 I was awarded and commenced a Marie Currie Fellowship investigating biofilm formation and the type six secretion system. I am now a Senior Lecturer in Molecular Bacteriology of Respiratory Infections at NHLI and have a long-standing interest in chronic respiratory pathogens. ",

      "Earth’s magnetic field acts a barrier to the solar wind, forming our magnetosphere with a bow shock upstream that slows and deflects the supersonic plasma around it. However, this is a highly dynamic and non-linear process with many complicated feedback mechanisms. These result in various transient phenomena which can have localised and even global impacts on the magnetosphere affecting the energetic particles in the radiation belts, electrical currents directed into and through the top of the atmosphere, auroral processes and launching a cacophony of different ultra-low frequency waves analogous to sound. These impacts can severely impact on our space- and ground-based technology and infrastructure, resulting in technological, economic and societal repercussions known as space weather. My research career has focused on many of these dynamical processes, investigating their origins, properties and consequences.",

      "Neil Alford received his BSc from St Andrews University and spent three years working in SE Asia and S America in the Oil Exploration Industry.  He returned to the UK to carry out his PhD at Queen Mary College in the area of fracture mechanics of cement mortars. He carried out post doctoral work at Oxford University in collaboration with ICI developing high strength cement. He joined ICI Corporate Laboratory in 1981 and was involved with projects concerning macro defect free cement, viscous processing of ceramics and the properties of perovskite ceramics, specifically High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). The application of HTS to microwave devices was a major area and part of this activity has been now transferred to industry for cellular communications. He joined London South Bank University in 1994 and developed HTS Magnetic resonance receive coils, microwave dielectrics, novel signal transformers and ferroelectric thin films. His work on microwave dielectric materials has resulted in the development of ultra low loss alumina resonators and an understanding of the defect chemistry of TiO2 which has allowed the production of very high Q and high dielectric constant materials. This technology has been patented and transferred to industry.",
      " ",
      "Technology transfer is a key focus and Neil’s discoveries have been applied widely in industry, including cellular communications. His research on low loss microwave dielectrics and functional materials led to the development of the first room temperature, earth’s field MASER (a Microwave laser).    At Imperial he has served as Head of Department of Materials, Vice Dean for Research in the Faculty of Engineering and Associate Provost.  In 2013 he was awarded the MBE for services to Engineering.",

      "My research focuses on determining the functions and activation mechanisms of cytoplasmic Nod-like receptors (NLRs). NLRs modulate several anti-microbial functions including the activation of NF-kB and inflammasomes, a multimeric complex consisting of an NLR member together with adaptor ASC and pro-Caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been extensively studied largely due to its’ roles in infectious and inflammatory disorders. However, the activation mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome remain ambiguous. We are interested in understanding how cellular metabolic pathways impact inflammasome activity. Our recent studies demonstrated cellular cholesterol transport as a key homeostatic mechanism regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome thereby highlighting a new perspective on the metabolic control of inflammasome. We are now interested in further characterizing the cholesterol transport pathways to decipher how they impact inflammasome activation and cellular metabolism, and whether these pathways might affect immune responses to pathogenic and ‘sterile’ stimuli. Our studies would lead to the identification of targets that calibrate immune responses to maintain cellular homeostasis."

      "I have used routinely collected clinical and administrative data to examine variations in quality and safety in healthcare. My research has increased the use of data in the management and monitoring of healthcare in the UK and internationally. My work has led to the development of innovative statistical and computational methods for processing large data sets derived from electronic medical records and NHS databases. In my work examining paediatric cardiac surgical outcomes for the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry, I confirmed serious concerns around the surgical outcomes at Bristol and established the usefulness of routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics) in helping to identify quality of care issues.  In further research commissioned by the Shipman Inquiry and published in 2003, I established the role that statistical process control charts (specifically log likelihood CUSUM charts), and other routinely collected data (from death certificates) could play in the continuous surveillance of healthcare outcomes, and in this specific case, the detection of unusual patterns of patient mortality within General Practices.  I have demonstrated comparable (or better) coverage and completeness of routinely collected administrative data compared to clinical audit data. I have also demonstrated the strength of risk prediction models based on hospital administrative data compared to clinical data. I have developed indicators of healthcare performance based on hospital mortality patient safety indicators,and more recently stroke care and returns to theatre. I have also led the development of a national surveillance tool, the Real-Time Monitoring System (RTM as it is known), designed to monitor hospital outcomes across a range of diagnosis and procedure groups in near real time with data updated monthly. More recent research carried out by the unit since 2007 has refined this system, setting thresholds based on false alarm rates within CUSUM charts for multiple institutions, the automation of multiple risk adjustment models, the incorporation of hierarchical modelling techniques, the refinement of co-morbidity indices and the development of new indicators with potentially greater sensitivity than mortality. Other work on out of hours healthcare outcomes, most recently my work on elective procedures and mortality by day of the week have resulted in policy changes towards increasing clinical cover at weekends within the NHS.",

My research focuses on geographical variations in disease outcomes at population level. I use national-level, administrative datasets with linkage to look at patterns of variation after correcting for noise.

      "Dr Abel is a Senior Lecturer in Musculoskeletal Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at Imperial College London. He is a PI in the Musculoskeletal laboratory (MSk) where he leads the Bone Health Group supervising a multidisciplinary team of clinical and non-clinical scientists. Richie has authored more than 60 journal articles and book chapters, that have been cited over 2700 times (H-Index 31). Richie is the co-creator and co-host of the BoneUp podcast which aims to empower people living with bone disease and their families. The podcast received the 2022 Neil Mackenzie Public Engagement Award from the Bone Research Society.",
      " ",
      "Richie’s research pursues the evidence base for healthcare and environmental policy. His primary goals are to discover the mechanisms behind the remarkable mechanical properties of bone and better understand how ageing and environmental factors, like environmental pollution, modulate the response to mechanical loading, predisposing bones to osteoporotic fracture from the molecular scale up. Then apply the knowledge and evidence base to improve policy, diagnostics, and interventions for bone disease.",
      " ",
      "His technical innovations have resulted in new methods for studying tissue and organ mechanics from the molecular scale-up. His work included introducing synchrotron imaging methods to bone health research in humans. He combines synchrotron X-ray imaging techniques with microscopy and atomistic molecular dynamic modelling to determine the molecular and nanoscale mechanisms responsible for altering higher-scale mechanical properties in bone. Riche applies the methods to study the mechanisms underlying the effects of ageing and the environment on bone health and disease.",
      "Richie is translating the research by testing the application of bone health measures for clinical decision-making in surgery of the hip and spine. His work also includes the introduction of novel diagnostic and screening technologies in healthcare to improve the identification and treatment of osteoporosis. Richie works with companies developing healthcare technologies (e.g., X-ray and ultrasound) by supporting the design and delivery of preclinical and clinical trials. Richie also studies the natural history of bone stress injuries in dancers (ballet and contemporary) to improve the health and well-being of dancers and develop decision-making around ceasing and then returning to play.",
      "Richie is a JBMR Plus Editorial Board (2022-2024) and has served on numerous committees and working groups supporting research and translation including the Royal Osteoporosis Society (Cure Advisory Group, Technology Academy), The Diamond Light (K11 DIAD beamline), the British Orthopaedic Society (Secretary). He chaired the organising committee of the British Orthopaedic Society (2018) and sits on the Royal Osteoporosis Society Conference Committee (2023).",
      "Richie is well-known for his research investigating why some people age healthily whilst others sustain osteoporotic fractures. Their milestone papers are published in Scientific Reports (, ) and were featured on BBC Radio, ToDay programme 1/3/2017, Inside Health programme 14/3/2017, Guardian 13/3/2017, and Daily Mail 27/8/20. The work provided unique insight as it addressed bone mechanics at a near-molecular scale enabled by synchrotron diffraction experiments. The group is one of only a handful worldwide with demonstrated expertise to carry out these unique experiments. Publishing an invited review on the clinical importance of molecular bone mechanics in Current Osteoporosis Reports ().",
      "This research was funded by The Royal Osteoporosis Society, the Wellcome Trust Accelerator Award, and donations from Michael Uren Foundation and The Doctor Mortimer & Teresa Sackler Foundation.

For the first time in history, the computerization of government and the availability of alternative data sources like satellite imagery and private firm data make it possible to study the process of economic development at high resolution. We believe that economic opportunity is often a highly local phenomenon: children only benefit from nearby schools, and workers in a location can only access jobs within commuting range. We have spent the last decade assembling a wide range of economic data on every village and town in India (N=600,000): living standards, firms, infrastructure, agricultural productivity, etc. This is the basis of much of my research, but we have also made it publicly available through the SHRUG open data platform, which has been downloaded over 15,000 times to date.

      "With a longstanding interest in epigenetics and chromatin biology, Dr. Shuchi Agrawal-Singh’s research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer originating from white blood cells of the myeloid lineage. AML is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and blocked differentiation. Agrawal-Singh’s lab is interested in investigating how mutations in epigenetic modulators leads to dysregulated “epigenetic language” driving abnormal- gene transcription, chromatin organisation and impact biomolecular condensation in leukemogenesis, with the aim of implementing these discoveries for the development of novel epigenetic therapies. ",
      "Dr. Agrawal Singh received her PhD in Biology (Molecular Haematology/Oncology) from University of Muenster, Germany. Her work was amongst the earlier studies that defined the importance of DNA-promoter-hypermethylation in silencing tumour suppressor genes in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and to use it as potential MRD-biomarker for predicting relapse risk in AML patients. She received an outstanding PhD with 3 first author and 4 co-authored publications. Moving on with independent postdoctoral fellowship from Danish Research Council (FSS), she joined BRIC (Copenhagen University) for postdoctoral training. Her work at BRIC, demonstrated the dynamic role of Polycomb repressive complex (PRC2) in regulating the lineage specific enhancer and transcriptional control during human-mesenchymal stem-cells differentiation. Further her research continued at University of Cambridge, probing the molecular epigenetic mechanisms underlying AML pathogenesis and her work revealed a novel function of transcription factor HOXA9 as transcriptional repressor required to prevent differentiation in AML.

      "Diversity of populations of plant pathogens is the theme for two current projects, one involving Phytophthora disease of cocoa in which Alex Appiah (in collaboration with CABI Egham) is examining a range of isolates of the two main species that are currently found on this host in Ghana. One of these, the more agressive, is currently spreading steadily through the main cocoa-growing areas and is of great concern. In the other project Ansar Ali is studying the range of cultural characteristics of isolates of Rhizoctonia found on rice in Bangladesh, as a prelude to molecular fingerprinting of the isolates and comparison of their relative pathogenicity.",
      "",
      "Two linked projects on the mycotoxin patulin are currently in progress. Established work on the physiology of the main producer, Penicillium expansum, growing post-harvest on stored apple, is being supported by a new study examining field factors that might explain the relative preponderance of patulin 'outbreaks' on some farms compared with others. The Silwood Park orchard, an environment unsprayed for many years is being used to establish baseline ecological information on pathogen abundance and habitat.",
      "",
      "Plant pathologists continue to make an input to the work of the environmental pollution group, Julie Beare finished her studies on the interactions between Melampsora and Marsonnina leaf diseases of poplar and the incidence of ozone pollution. Meanwhile, Nic Jarraud is examining a parallel system, that of tar spot of sycamore, but this time including aphid infestation in a four member interaction. Human interference seems to have influenced distribution of this disease in unpredictable ways and current gaseous pollutants are but one and probably not dominant factor."

This work was based at the Queen Mary University of London Preventive Neurology Unit, supervised by Prof Alastair Noyce.",

      "Dr. Suhaib Ardah is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Tribology Group at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Imperial College London. His research focuses on the development of advanced numerical tools to achieve a comprehensive understanding of fluid-solid interactions across multiple spatio-temporal scales, ranging from macroscopic to microscopic levels.",
      "",
      "Dr. Ardah is currently a member of the prestigious 5-year EPSRC-funded collaboration between Imperial College London, Shell, and Diamond Light Source (InFUSE Prosperity Partnership). This initiative is dedicated to advancing the transition to net-zero emissions by deepening our understanding of interface behaviours through a multidisciplinary approach that investigates morphology, structure and chemistry across scales, from the atomic to the macroscale and under extreme operational conditions. His role focuses on developing novel computational modelling techniques designed to bridge the gap between different scales, ergo linking atomic-level phenomena with macroscopic behaviours and offering critical insights that inform the design and optimisation of sustainable engineering solutions.",
      "",
      "Dr. Ardah completed his PhD in the Tribology Group at Imperial College London under the supervision of Professor Daniele Dini and Dr. Tom Reddyhoff, in collaboration with Dr. Francisco J. Profito from the Polytechnic School of the University of São Paulo. His research focused on developing a fully coupled Reynolds-based computational framework for analysing various lubricated systems. The framework integrates the generalised Reynolds equation, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, with the thermal energy equation using mass-conserving finite volume schemes, enabling the study of complex interactions such as hydrodynamic effects, lubricant rheology and interfacial heat generation. Collaborating closely with experimentalists, Dr. Ardah aligned his theoretical models with experimental data to enhance their practical applicability. His work also involved collaborations with industrial partners such as Safran, SKF, Shell and P&G.",
      "",
      "Prior to joining Imperial College in 2019, he achieved his MEng degree in Mechanical Engineering (First Class Hons.) at Cardiff University in 2019 under the guidance of Professor H.P. (Pwt) Evans, a renowned expert in the field of tribology. His work focused on evaluating how temperature variations influence the behaviour of lubricated interfaces under elliptical contact conditions by implementing numerical models capable of providing valuable insights into the interplay between heat generation and fluid dynamics.",

      "Véronique Azuara is an Associate Professor/Reader in Stem Cell Biology, Head of Section for Gonadal and Developmental Biology at Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, and an Associate Member of the Development and Stem Cell Interest Group at the Francis Crick Institute. ",
      " ",
      "Véronique is originally from Paris where she obtained her PhD for work on the molecular genetics of lymphocyte development at the Institute Pasteur (Department of Immunology). She then crossed the channel and joined the MRC London Laboratory of Medical Sciences in the group of Professor Dame Amanda Fisher. Here, she explored as an MRC Postdoctoral Fellow how chromatin ‘shutdown’ contributes to lineage restriction and maintenance of cell fate identity through development. Notably, her work in embryonic stem cells, among others, pioneered the discovery that many inactive developmental regulators carry bivalent chromatin structure being enriched for repressive marks and indicators of active chromatin. This bivalent marking is proposed to prime lineage-specifying genes for future activation yet prevent their premature expression through Polycomb-mediated repression. ",
      " ",
      "In 2006 Véronique started her independent research group at the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology (IRDB) of Imperial College London supported by an MRC Collaborative Career Development Award in Stem Cells and a BBSRC New Investigator Award. Her group has since focussed on understanding how cell potency and differentiation are balanced in stem cells and in the developing mammalian embryo. In the early embryo, this implies unravelling how cell heterogeneity arises, how pluripotency is achieved and safeguarded while promoting the formation of essential extra-embryonic lineages, and how the pluripotent embryonic tissue itself is remodelled upon implantation in preparation for all subsequent differentiation events and foetal growth. Combining in vivo studies with embryo stem cell models, her group pursues a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach to address these questions from transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic perspectives. Most recently, her group uncovered a previously unrecognized link between lipid metabolism and the morphogenesis of pluripotent stem cell progenitors during peri-implantation development, with a specific focus on lipid droplet biology. ",
      " ",
      "Throughout her journey, Véronique grew an active interest in developing others as the mother of two daughters, a caring research group leader and mentor, teaching module leads and tutor, a university-wise champion for early career researchers as well as acting as departmental lead in research culture/Athena Swan. In 2024, she was awarded an Imperial President’s Medal for Excellence in Research Environment (Ethics, Culture, and Sustainability).",

      "in the field of attosecond physics. I study fundamental ultrafast electronic processes that occur in molecules and clusters following excitation and/or ionisation, for example by a laser pulse. These electronic transitions, such as Auger decay, interatomic (intermolecular) Coulombic decay (ICD) and others, are driven by electron-electron interaction and are the basic manifestation of the electron correlation in nature. They are of high practical importance for estimation and understanding of the radiation damage done by high-frequency radiation. My group is developing and using first principles many-electron theoretical methods to investigate the complex dynamics of the known electronic rearrangements and to predict new physical phenomena of this type. The ab initio computational method developed in my group recently, B-spline algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC), allows us to look inside the radiative and non-radiative many-electron transitions in order to study the onset and the effect of quantum coherence on these phenomena.",

My research areas are Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services, and text and social network mining. Currently, my research focuses on studying key technologies in semantic content management, and applying them in the domains of news, social networks, and web services. I have published about 90 papers in international journals and conferences including SIGIR, SIGMOD, SIGKDD, ISWC, CIKM, JoDS, JoWS etc.",
      "1. Ontology-based semantic content management. In semantic content management, ontology matching and semantic annotation are our main research topics. In ontology matching, we proposed a Bayes decision-based ontology matching framework, and further proposed a dynamic ontology matching framework to solve the aggregation problem of different matching methods for difference matching tasks. Our related work has been published in many papers such as JoWS, TKDE, and SIGMOD, and the citation number of our JoWS paper by Google Scholar is 73. In semantic annotation, we have developed three models to annotate different kinds of resources with different characteristics, including rule-based model named iASA, an SVM classification-based method, and a CRFs-based model. These models have been applied in different annotation tasks such as research profiling, stock annual report extraction, and conference annotation. The above work is funded by NSFC and National 973 Basic Research Program.",
      "2. News and Social Network Mining. In news mining, we proposed index tree and name entity-based topic detection and tracking method, and further proposed a topic-based news exploration framework. This research is published in SIGIR 2007 and demoed in SIGKDD 2009. In social network mining, we proposed an expertise-oriented social network search framework, which has been used in a practical academic social network mining system-Arnetminer. We have also studied the problems of expert finding, conference mining, and research interest finding.",
      "3. XML application in news domain. I am the fourth author of China Standard Chinese News Markup Language (CNML) (GB/T20092-2006), and the PI for the project named CNML Management System.

      "Teaching Profile",
      "I have taught 18 different courses for undergraduates and graduates at the Department of Computing in Hong Kong Polytechnic University (1997-1999), Department of Information Systems and Management in Tilburg University in The Netherlands (1999-2002), Department of Computer Science in University of Twente in The Netherlands (2002-2006), and Department of Computer Science and technology in Tsinghua University inChina(2006-). These courses span from fundamental database theory, database design, (advanced) distributed multimedia databases, secure data management, object-oriented programming paradigm, data structure and algorithm, information system development, operating systems, frontier software technologies to computer programming for non-majors.",
      "During the past 3 years, my major teaching efforts were spent on the 1st year bachelor course on programming fundamentals which is open to all the university students. I believe that computing education for non-majors must be distinguished from that for computing-major students. Students in these classes are from diverse backgrounds and are heading on diverse directions. They work with entities (e.g., signals, images, equations, tables of data, etc.) , and have different thoughts about computing. Many times they think of computers as a tool rather than an object of intrinsic interest. Computation is not their primary interest or career goal, and often very limited time is devoted to their formal study of computation.",
      "According to these characteristics of the students and their requirements on the course, in my teaching, I pick up examples which are accessible at an intuitive level by different kinds of students, or those in their working domains. To let the course be directly useful, the course materials guide the students how to represent and operate on diverse entities in their domains rather than focus on abstract complex data structures like AVL trees. Overall, the course teaching aims to introduce to the students the fundamental programming methodology, and meanwhile empower the students with a strong intuition regarding the power of computing, what computers can do, and what computers cannot.",

      "Research Status",
      "I have been in the area of data management for over 30 years. My research interests include context-aware secure data management towards Ambient Intelligence, data mining and warehousing, and distributed object-oriented database management systems, etc. As a principal investigator, co-principal investigator, or key project member, I have undertaken over 30 national and international projects in the Mainland of China, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and Australia, and published over 200 scientific articles in high-quality international conferences or journals (including ACM TOIS, IEEE TKDE, J. VLDB, J-BHI, etc.).",
      "One of my work in secure data management was patented by the Royal Philips in theNetherlandsdue to its innovation and applicability in 2003.The key contribution that I made in the area of data mining is to extend the work on association rule analysis from intra transactional analysis to inter transactional analysis. This is of particular significance when one is looking at forecasting systems. This is the first work which has done this kind of extension. In the area of data warehouses, I provided explanatory semantics for data warehouses using linguistic representations and fuzzy reasoning. In the area of XML databases, I developed techniques which do transformation of object oriented systems as well as a conceptual graph approach to the design of XML documents. I once proposed a context-aware data management and service paradigm towards Ambient Intelligence, which has raised a number of challenging issues in the next-generation mobile intelligent data management field. This work received the NWO VIDI Vernieuwingsimpuls (innovational) outstanding individual prize, awarded by the Dutch Organization of Scientific Research, which is the most prestigious award given to outstanding researchers in the Neterlands, and I was the first winner from the IT field since the setting up of this award in 2000.",

      "Research Summary",
      "An important theme that resides at the center of my research is the interaction of multiple entities. It spans across most of my works, from algorithmic game theory to distributed ledgers. Indeed, compared to computer systems from many decades ago, where each computer ran individually to execute single-machine programs, today’s computer systems and networks often have more than one participant interact in a distributed environment. E-commerce, social networks, and multi-robot systems are all handy examples, among many others. The participants include both human beings and artificial intelligence, and their objectives in the same system may vary from one to another. Often, by making individual decisions and taking individual actions, they collectively make progress and achieve the system’s goal set forth by its designer, such as social efficiency, global consensus, etc. My research is to design such systems and characterize their behavior using rigorous theory, so that individual decision-making leads the system towards its global goal, not only efficiently, but also securely and robustly under adversarial environments.",

We work on novel physical design algorithms based on the hierarchical design concept and divide-and-conquer technique to reduce design complexity introduced by the 3rd dimension. As technology advances, IC goes larger and larger. We are attempting to find a fast algorithm to solve the problems in ultra-large and mixed-mode placement, such as multiple objectives, many constraints, and clock node distributions. We have proposed some methods for interconnect planning and optimization for low-power, thermal and yield-in nanometer IC design.

      "My research group has addressed fundamental problems of service computing, designed efficient algorithms for automatic service composition, and developed various service composition systems. As service-oriented computing (SOC) becomes the new computing paradigm of the Internet, it is a big necessity to automatically combine some web services in a certain way to satisfy specific requirements. My research achieved remarkable improvement on efficiency of automatic service composition.",
      "My research group observes the data correlations between services' outputs and inputs. In existing works, data correlations are usually expressed in an implicit and automatic way by reasoning on data models or ontology models used in service definitions. My group proposes to express data correlations by explicit declarations. Referring to the fundamental idea of hyperlinks, the Service Data Link model (SDL) is proposed to explicitly declare data correlations among services. Furthermore, my group combines the expressive power of the SDL model with the Service Dependency Graph model (SDG), and present SDG+, an extended version of SDG, which introduces three extensions: 1) attribute quantifier, 2) attribute transform, and 3) explicit dependency. Taking advantage of explicit dependency, a major extension of SDG+, my group developed a composition algorithm for IEEE CEC Web Service Challenge 2007, which significantly improved the performance in dealing with datasets that contain complex inheritances among message types. The system designed based on this algorithm won the championship of Performance Evaluation in the competition.",
      "In our research of automatic composition problem of QoS-aware and non-predefined workflow, a theoretical data-driven and QoS-optimized service composition model is proposed. In order to acquire composition solutions with optimal end-to-end QoS, my group utilize the semantic information among data types to realize semantic matching in service composition, and have proposed two composition algorithms. One is based on iterative generation, which iteratively searches services and updates the optimal QoS values; the other is based on greedy procedure which always selects the services with optimal accumulated QoS values. The experiment results show that the two algorithms are able to solve the problem correctly and satisfy the efficiency requirement of runtime systems. The system designed based on these two algorithms won the first place team and first runner-up team of Performance Evaluation in IEEE CEC Web Service Challenge 2008 and 2009.",

      "Our simulator, called TSIM (Tsinghua SIMulator), is a fast and cycle-accurate memory sub-system modeling and evaluating framework for Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs). This simulator provides a flexible and extensible approach to evaluating architecture designs, models, and algorithms, including network-on-chip interconnection, cache hardware pre-fetcher, memory system protocol, replacement policy, etc.",
      "TSIM tries to balance among speed, accuracy and flexibility. By introducing the concept of statistical metamerics, TSIM separates the analysis stage from the simulation process. This provides a great facilitation for users to sample and analyze the performance metrics. More significantly, TSIM focuses on CMP systems and supports multithread workloads. A TSIM user is able to freely configure simulation parameters such as cache level, cache size, block size, number of cores, and the replacement policy.",

      "My research focuses on designing fundamental algorithms in the area of VLSI design automation. I develop systems and tools to optimize the physical layout and logical design of integrated circuits (ICs). I am also working on the algorithms for combinatorial optimization and stochastic optimization. As a research associate, I visited Prof. Jason Cong's group in UCLA in 2005. During one year's stay in UCLA, I developed 3D MEVA, an evaluation model for micro-architecture of 3D ICs. Recently, I've been leading several projects on 3D ICs. Related papers are published on top conferences such as ICCAD, DAC, ASPDAC, etc.",
      "In recent years, I have proposed several approaches to optimizing the physical design process of 2D and 3D ICs, which integrate various constraints such as timing, layout and power. To achieve efficient optimization of multiple objectives with complex constraints, an analytical optimization approach simulating the appealing and repelling force model is proposed for 3D ICs' packing process. In addition, I also proposed a novel incremental optimization process and its associated algorithms, which are helpful to the fast convergence of the complex designs.",
      "Most of my work aims at optimizing the design process of IC layout to improve its performance, reliability and cost efficiency. This topic lies between CS and EE, and I have been collaborating with several professors in both areas, investigating ways to improve the electronic design ability, as well as the algorithms in computer science.",

Basic architectures and construction methods of Internet based on loosely coupled information service grids were studied. Some novel resource discovery, location and scheduling mechanisms were presented. Furthermore, various models and algorithms were designed and evaluated. Additionally, my research group has developed several information systems to support National College and University Recruitment. The admission management subsystem and online recruitment subsystem in particular are large-scale distributed information systems, which have changed the workflow of admission management and enrollment, promoted its informationization process, and guaranteed an open and fair atmosphere of the recruitment procedure. These systems have become the most important and successful demonstration applications on CERNET (China Education and Research Network) and brought large amounts of economic and social benefits.",

      "1. Realization of High-Performance IPv4/v6 Router Architecture",
      "As a beginner in China of high-performance routers research, I have presided over many national programs relating to the research of high-performance IPv4/v6 routers. Our development of high-performance IPv6 routers began in 2000, and succeeded in 2004. In the R&D of routers, I was in charge of the design and development of hardware architecture and system, proposing a series of key technologies in router hardware including self-adaptive allocation method in large-scale dual-stack routing table, hardware redundancy method, high-speed switching technology, high-speed serial transmission technology, and hardware dual-stack wire-speed forwarding engine. They are capable of addressing the design and implementation of computing processing plane, network switching plane, high-speed serial backplane, 10G line cards, 2.5G line card, gigabit Ethernet line cards, system electromagnetic shielding, and ventilation of system routing.",
      "Our IPv6 Core Router passed the Network Access Test organized by Ministry of Information Industry, becoming the first equipment passing this high-end network accessing test. It was also appraised by Ministry of Information Industry in May 2004, and the comments acquired regarding hardware design and implementation are as follows: Key technologies such as routing table allocation method by dynamic self-adaptive dual-stack forwarding engines, and hardware redundancy method, realize major innovations. Among them, dual-stack mixed routing table technology has reached international leading level.",
      "2. Scalable Switching Network and Reconfigurable Routers",
      "I have engaged in the research of key technologies of scalable router architectures for a long time. My focus is hardware structure of scalable routers, which has issues including switching network structure of scalable routers, routing structure and strategies of scalable routers, and QoS issues of scalable routers.",
      "1) Switching Network Architecture of Scalable Routers. At present, almost all core routers in the world adopt Cross Bar switching structure. Its hardware complexity is O(n2) and its scalability complexity is high. Therefore, switching networks of core routers all have this scalability issue. I proposed a switching network architecture namedH-Torus, which is applicable to scalable routers by combining and improving 3D-Torus and cellular structure. Its hardware complexity is reduced to O (n), which has good scalability and switching performance.",
      "2) Routing Structure and Strategies of Scalable Routers. Due to the length difference of IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, the design and lookup method of dual-stack mixed routing table are design challenges of core routers and scalable routers. International companies such as Cisco and Juniper adopt independent IPv6/Ipv4 routing tables. I proposed a dynamic self-adaptive routing table allocation method for IPv6/v4 dual-stack forwarding engine. This method dynamically allocates the content of IPv6 and IPv4 routing table, solving the dual-stack mixed lookup issue. Besides, it supports dynamic allocation of IPv6/v4 routing table in the same physical system. Fast routing lookup can be achieved based on the flexible allocation of IPv6/IPv4 routing table numbers. This method improves the forwarding speed of routers, and has been successfully applied to core routers.",
      "3) QoS Issue of Scalable Routers. QoS control/guarantee is end-to-end behavior. Being one of the key issues, network equipment supporting QoS control is the basis of the whole network QoS. I proposed a multi-constraint QoS routing structure and caching management mechanism. The mechanism solves the linear increase issue of QoS routing tables, and reduces both time and space complexity of routing lookup algorithm.",

My research areas are mainly in next generation Internet protocol test based on formal methods, large-scale IPv6 network test, and Internet large-scale addressing and routing three aspects.",
      "1. In the research on formal methods based next generation Internet, my group proposed routing and robust test related theories and algorithms, designed a comprehensive set of next generation Internet IPv6 core protocol cases, and developed TTCN-3 based next generation Internet protocol integrated test system (PITS), making contributions for domestic IPv6 core router development.",
      "In the research of next generation Internet protocol test theory, we proposed dynamic threshold based BGP routing protocol real-time test theory and algorithm, inter domain routing convergence time algorithm combined with autonomous system hierarchy, robustness test algorithm combined with time constraints, communication multi-port finite state machine based protocol interoperability test generation algorithm etc. The self-designed whole set of routing protocols include IPv6 core protocols, address related protocols, transition protocols, and routing protocols etc., which have no precedent public report internationally. Besides, we developed TTCN-3 based next generation Internet protocol integrated test system (PITS). In developing domestic IPv6 core routers, we tested all the protocol realization, accelerating the development, and guaranteed the research and development quality using the above theories and algorithms, the whole unit of IPv6 protocol test cases, and the protocol integrated test system. The IPv6 core router we developed takes the lead in passing the Internet accessing test hold by the Ministry of Information Industry, and is widespread in China next generation Internet demonstrative project CNGI. It won the 1st class technological award of China Institute of Communications and major invention award of the Ministry of Information Industry in 2004, and the 2nd class national technological progress award in 2005.",

I presided over the design of all test cases, comprehensively tested the function, performance, and multi-vendor equipment interoperability, playing an important role in CNGI-CERNET2/6IX development.",
      "CNGI core network CNGI-CERNET/6IX is the largest trial network in CNGI project, and also the first pure IPv6 large-scale network in the world. It connects 25 core nodes of 20 cities throughout China and all IPv6 test network in the world with high speed and almost covers all types of IPv6 core routers. The interoperability, function, and performance test are complex, and critical to the system development. We proposed a distributed, synchronized-ordination and multi-coordination joint large-scale test model and scheme of pure IPv6 network without any precedent to learn from. The model is made according to test need, and combines with self-developed test equipment and advantages of various test devices. Besides, it integrates interoperability, function and performance test features. Based on the model, we designed a great number of test cases, relative completely test the multi-vendor interoperability, network function, and performance indicators and parameters. Thereby system development progress is sped up and network debug difficulties are simplified, playing a key role in promoting the system as a whole to world leading level. The project won the 1st class Science and Technology Progress Award of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Progress Award in 2006 and 2nd class National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2007.",

      "2. Research on P2P Network Traffic Classification & Management and Live Streaming Technology.",
      "This research proposes a new P2P network traffic estimation model, which possesses higher estimation accuracy than the recently proposed gravity and independent connection model. A P2P network traffic classification method is proposed based on P2P networks’ transmission behavior. This method has a simpler approach to classification with a higher success rate than the best result of previous classification methods proposed based on the Bayes’ Theorem. The paper has been cited for ten times since it was published in Computer Communications. A cache replacement algorithm based on P2P network live streaming media is proposed; it has higher cache efficiency than the previous representative cache method based on segments.",
      "A node selection and a transmission scheduling method based on P2P network live streaming media are proposed, solving the problem that the traditional random selection method can hardly guarantee the transmission quality of streaming media and being granted two patents of invention. Based on this achievement, Prof. Xu’s group and PPLive cooperated to develop and implement the cross-platform P2P video accelerator, PPVA. According to the measurement and statistics of the PPVA website, there have been 280 million times of downloading this software, which supports thousands of video web sites invisibly with more than 10 million on-line users downloading videos every day, effectively saving the network broad-band of video web sites and network operators.",

      "I began research and teaching in the field of computer networks in1977.I have presided over 20 major national research and engineering projects related to computer network.",
      "1. I presided over the CERNET demonstration project in 1994, when China still did not have large-scale Internet design and construction experiences. Through hard working and collaborative research with other 10 universities, we successfully built the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) demonstration project. CERNET is an ambitious project of our country for the twenty-first century. Being an advanced computer network that covers the whole country, its technology has reached international advanced level of the 90s. It was awarded second-class National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 1997. In this project, I put forward a large-scale Internet architecture design scheme which contains the core ideas of connectionless packet switching, flow-based sub-regional routing and accounting, a large-scale Internet operation and management system based on the technologies of running flow active network element and data link dynamic acquisition, and a security system based on cycle-based security view. I have been responsible for the technical work of CERNET for a long period and presided over the completion of six major national projects. CERNET now has become the world's largest national academic network, which played an important role in accelerating the technological progress of China's Internet and promoting the use and training of it.",
      "2. I have long been engaged in the research of computer network routing and switching technologies. I presided over the development of IPv6 core router. The success of the IPv6 core router is a major breakthrough of key network technologies, and it promoted the localization process of key network equipment development in China. In the 1980s, in the severe situation of the restrictions on Chinese imports of foreign network equipment, I have successful presided over the developments of many key network equipment such as X.25 packet switching network and routing device, advanced network processor and high-performance security router, and promoted the use of these equipment in real networks. Core router is the heart of the Internet. It includes complicated technologies and only the United States, Japan and other technologically advanced countries master its core technology at that time. China's Internet formerly relied on foreign routers, which brought a significant risk to national security. In 2004, I worked with my colleagues and finished the development of IPv6 Core Router with independent intellectual properties. It is the first internal router that passed the IPv6 Core Router Test Specification (Draft) test by Ministry of Information Industry. Its overall technology has reached international advanced and domestic leading level, and it has four important innovations including the scalable router operating system BWOS. Its mixed IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack routing table method and new methods for establishing IPv4overIPv6 tunnel are in the leading positions in the world. This research result was awarded the second-class National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 2005. It gained five national invention patents, and has been widely used in network projects such as CNGI (China Next Generation Internet) program.",
      "3. I have long been engaged in the research of Internet architecture and protocol theory, and key technologies of Internet, and have made some innovative research results. In the 1980s, I proposed the theory of protocol conformance test systems based on expanded labeled transition system, developed a TCP/IP protocol conformance test system to effectively test the Internet protocols. In 2003, I was hired as the chief scientist of the National 973 Project Theoretical Study on a New Generation Internet, and led project team to work hard and achieve a number of innovative research results, such as a new Internet architecture which has multi-dimension scalabilities in aspects of scale, function, performance, security and service. I put forward the roadmap of Constructing the Large-scale Pure IPv6 Internet Backbone, which aims to address the technical problems of large-scale IPv6 backbone such as network topology and routing design, addressing and naming planning, network measurement and management. I also put forward an IPv4overIPv6 Transition theory, which used inexplicit tunneling technology to solve the technical problems such as IPv4 and IPv6 compatibility, transmission mapping, manageability, scalability, security and auto-configuration. I proposed an Authentic IPv6 Source Address Architecture which has become one of the important technical foundations of trusted next generation Internet. The above results have applied for 11 Chinese patents (3 authorized), promoted the Internet standards organization IETF to set up Softwire and SAVI working groups, and submitted 10 IETF draft standards and 1 CCSA standard. I am the first author of RFC 5210, RFC 5565 and RFC 5747.",
      "4. I presided over the major national projects CNGI-CERNET2/6IX, which improved China's next generation Internet technologies to the international competitive position. I started next generation Internet research in 1998 and presided over the NSFCNET project in 2000, which achieved 10Gbps high-speed IPv6 testbed for the first time in China using IP/DWDM technology, and are able to connect to the international Next Generation Internet. In 2003, I presided over the China Next Generation Internet core network CNGI-CERNET2/6IX project by uniting 25 universities. This project is currently the world's largest pure IPv6 Internet backbone. It designed and constructed a large-scale next generation Internet backbone mainly based on domestic equipments, which has a major impact both domestically and internationally. It has a number of major innovations which includes: building large-scale pure IPv6 Internet backbone, authentic IPv6 source address architecture, and IPv4overIPv6 transitional technology. They are all international initiatives and reached world leading level. This project strongly promoted China's core network device industrialization and made an important contribution to China's participation in international Next Generation Internet test bed. In this project, I proposed a technology roadmap for building a large-scale pure IPv6 Internet backbone, a major strategy of mainly using domestic core IPv6 routers to construct large-scale backbone, and key technologies of authentic IPv6 source address architecture and IPv4overIPv6 transitional theory. This project has major impacts on international academic community. The results were awarded Second National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 2007 and rated as Top Ten Scientific and Technological Progress of China in 2004 and 2006.",
      "5. I have long been active in Internet area. I was the APAN Vice-Chairman since 1999 and was elected as Chairman of APAN in 2008. I was awarded as China's Top Ten Scientific and Technological Excellence by IEEE Spectrum in 2005 and gained IPv6 Pioneer Award by IPv6 Forum in 2007. I have chaired IEEE, ICNP, ICDCS and other international conferences.",

      "I have been mainly working in the following areas:",
      "1. Traffic Control in Computer Networks. Many factors throw obstacles in building a refined dynamic model for transport subsystem in computer networks, such as diversity of traffic statistical distribution, nonlinear coupling imposed by protocols, and time-varying characteristics of network states. Although heuristic algorithms for traffic control can be obtained without the support of system model, they can only work normally under some special environments. Through limited simulations (even experiments), the comprehensive evaluation on performance of these heuristic algorithms is difficult to be conducted, and in-depth understanding and sensible insights are hardly to be obtained. In our work in this area, the network traffic control subsystem will be considered as a nonlinear time-varying delay closed-loop system. Using some proper approximation techniques, such as fluid flow and local linearization, the transport subsystems in computer networks are described by linear differential equations. Combining with these coarse-grained models, the classical analysis approaches in linear and nonlinear control theory, such as describing function, phase plane and Lyapunov function, are used to analyze the stability of typical transport subsystems in computer networks, including TCP/AQM, ATM/FECI, Ethernet/BCN, etc. The explicit criterions of system stability are deduced, which provide some valuable guidelines to parameter settings for stable network operation. Otherwise, these theoretical results also give a reasonable interpretation of some phenomena occurring in transport subsystem. For example, the queue oscillation with identical amplitude should be limit cycle caused by the nonlinear elements embedded into traffic control algorithms. On the other hand, borrowing population ecology evolution theory and utilizing the design techniques in robust control theory, such as internal model control, sliding mode variable structure control and fuzzy control, we develop a series of flow control and congestion control algorithms for heterogeneous computer networks, including ultra-high-speed, large delay, mobile and wireless networks.",
      "2. Wireless Sensor Network Architecture and Protocols Design. The coherent architecture and common programming model are crucial for large scale deployment of applications based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Following the philosophy of active network, we construct a reference model for WSN architecture, which enables sensor nodes programmability, dynamic loading/unloading of protocols, and the online updating of codes. In addition, the new architecture can improve code reusability and reliability, and can shorten development and deployment cycle of large-scale commercial applications. Finally, it is capable of reducing management cost. On the other hand, exploiting the redundancy of densely deployed sensor nodes and the centripetal pattern (i.e. many-to-one) existing in traffic spatial distribution, and borrowing the concept of potential field in physics, we construct different potential fields referring to different state parameters in networks, and then superpose them into a virtual potential field to drive packets to move directionally in networks. This paradigm can realize the basic function of routing, while can endow additional attributes, including balancing energy consumption, alleviating congestion and assisting data aggregation. Additionally, the other related protocols in WSNs, such as reliable transport, time synchronization and congestion control, are developed.",

      "IPv4/IPv6 transition technology has been the major constraint in modern Internet development. My research team has initially proposed the 4over6 mesh architecture in the world, and designed and implemented 4over6 mesh protocol based on dynamic non-dominant tunnel. This has won high attention from IETF, and thus Softwire group was established. Based on this protocol, many national patents have been filed. I have published many papers in influential journals in the network field such as IEEE Internet Computing, and accomplished RFC 5565 and RFC 5747. Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) has assigned a specific sub-address cluster identifier SAFI=67 to identify 4over6 function of network nodes. This protocol has been deployed to large-scale test on CERNET2, providing significant solution for pure IPv6 backbone building and IPv6 transition. It has been remarked as an international initiative by the technical appraisal committee including ten CAS and CAE fellows, and won the First-class Prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education in 2007.",
      "Core routers are the key equipment of the Internet. I have participated in the overall design of IPv6 core routers, proposed IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel, and been responsible for the design and implementation of the subsystem. Having passed technical appraisal, our overall technology reaches international advanced and national top level. It has made major innovation in four key technologies including the tunnel setup scheme of realizing IPv4 on IPv6 networks. Among them, IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel and other two technologies have reached international advanced level. I have received the Second-class Award of National Science and Technology Progress Award, and Significant Technological Innovation Award by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.",
      "Wireless network and mobile computing are significant directions of future Internet. I have studied the collaborative optimization routing framework based on backbone and access networks. Game optimization has been made on network transmission and user access. Multi-channel multi-path mesh backbone routing protocol has been designed using cross-level technologies. Besides, data center-oriented wireless mesh networking architecture and its key technologies have been proposed. Based on those research results, many important papers have been published, and my research group has been supported by Natural Science Foundation, international joint programs, and other funding.",

      "Research Status",
      "I have been engaged in research in the field of artificial intelligence, focusing on intelligent optimization scheduling and human-machine natural interaction, with a particular emphasis on multimodal intelligent information processing and the control of integrated robots. We conduct our research at research platforms such as the National Research Center of Information Science and Technology in Beijing. In recent years, we have completed three major national scientific and technological projects, four projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, two projects under the National 973 Program, five projects under the National 863 Program, and collaborated on thirteen projects with international Fortune 500 companies. We have been invited to serve as core experts for the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's Major Science and Technology Project No. 03. Additionally, we have served as the leaders of the expert group for the acceptance of the National Key Research and Development Program Technical Support for Economic Development 2020. We are advisory experts for the National Industrial Innovation Center of the National Development and Reform Commission and the Editors-in-Chief of the international journal Intelligent Systems Applications published by Elsevier and the Deputy Editors-in-Chief of Expert Systems Applications (first quartile, SCI impact factor = 8.665).We have received numerous awards and honors, including a second-class National Science and Technology Progress Award, a first-class Beijing Science and Technology Award, two first-class awards from industry associations for scientific and technological achievements, and three second and third-class awards at the provincial and ministerial levels. We have obtained 36 national invention patents, 26 software copyrights, and authored three textbooks and six monographs. Our contributions have been cited in top journals such as ACM Computing Surveys and referenced by six academicians from both domestic and international institutions, as well as over 30 IEEE fellows. In the field of intelligent robot optimization scheduling, we have proposed intelligent evolutionary theories for multi-objective optimization scheduling and flexible job shop scheduling (FJS) methods for multi-robot collaboration. In the area of robot natural interaction, we have researched and established methods and open platforms for emotion analysis and intent understanding in natural interaction, which have become effective approaches in the field of intelligent robotic systems for perceiving emotional states and understanding dialogue intents.",

      "My research primarily focuses on quantum architecture and systems, as well as quantum error correction and fault tolerance. In the domain of quantum architecture and systems, my collaborators and I have proposed redefining quantum instruction sets to unlock the full potential of quantum chips. We have introduced a series of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum instruction designs along with their microarchitectural implementations, significantly enhancing the accuracy of quantum program execution.",
      "In the realm of quantum error correction and fault tolerance, we have developed a real-time quantum error decoding scheme that operates in the time domain, enabling scalable error correction. This approach has successfully reduced the per-cycle error processing time on superconducting quantum chips to within one microsecond, effectively resolving the backlog issue.",
      "Building on this foundation, we have further advanced techniques such as vector processor acceleration for quantum computing and configurable quantum instruction sets, addressing the challenges of large-scale quantum chip addressing and control overhead. Leading a collaborative project, we have developed a complete system encompassing quantum instructions and control instructions, a quantum compilation framework, quantum error correction middleware, and control electronics. This work has realized the full-stack control of quantum chips, demonstrating a prototype implementation of a fault-tolerant quantum computing system, which has undergone initial testing and validation on actual quantum hardware.",
      "I have published nearly 70 papers in leading journals and conferences across computer science and physics, including Nature Computational Science, Physical Review Letters, PRX Quantum, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Communications in Mathematical Physics, and ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing, as well as conferences such as QIP, ASPLOS, and DAC.",

      "My research interests are Web information retrieval (IR) and user behavior analysis. In most IR tasks, user queries are always short and fuzzy, while the known document space is huge with complex information. Therefore, the main problem in IR lies in the mismatch of information representations between the user query space and the known document space. This is what my work is abased on. My research contributions are:",
      "In the research of IR approaches to better document modeling, we studied the nature of novelty information, focusing on how to find new and non-redundant information to a user's request. We have proposed a document refinement approach based on query expansion, and a selective pooling-based document matching strategy. For document representation, an object-based document description is proposed. We also propose a unified generation model for topic relevance and opinion sentiments. The work has been published on important international journals and conferences, such as Journal of IR, SIGIR, CIKM, etc. One patent has been granted.",
      "We are also leveraging wisdom of crowds and studying user behaviors based on large-scale user log data. Our proposed web page quality estimation and anti-spam algorithms are able to solve the robustness and timeliness problem of state-of-art technologies. Our automatic search engine performance evaluation approach handles the problems of the time and labor cost by human annotation. Currently, the automatic evaluation service for six main Chinese commercial search engines are daily provided online. We also study to understand user intentions, build user browsing graphs, and predict users' satisfaction level. Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of user behavior, and propose a model of user reliability and click relevance, which estimates the quality using both hot queries/clicks and long tail queries/clicks. This study has been published on important international journals and conferences, such as JASIST, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, etc. 8 patents have been filed, four of which were granted. Our proposed approaches have also been deployed on Sogou online search engine via Tsinghua-Sohu Joint Research Lab, and demonstrated good results and high potential in real web applications.",

Floyd-Hoare logic is a foundation of axiomatic semantics of classical programs, and it provides effective proof techniques for reasoning about the correctness of classical programs. To offer similar techniques for quantum program verification and to build a logical foundation of programming methodology for quantum computers, I developed a full-fledged Hoare logic for both partial and total correctness of quantum programs. In particular, the (relative) completeness of this logic is proved. The proof techniques are quite different from those for classical programs and need mathematical tools.",

      "My research interests are computational linguistics, statistical and corpus-based natural language processing (NLP), Chinese language computing (computational morphology, bilingual terminology extraction), information retrieval (Chinese text categorization, graphical model-based keyword extraction), collective intelligence (tag generation, Web trend analysis) and social computing (query log analysis, community discovery). I have participated as project leader or principal researcher in over 20 projects funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Social Science Foundation of China, National 863 High-Tech Program, National 973 Basic Research Program, as well as in projects funded by a number of international IT companies. I have published, together with my students, about 130 papers in academic journals and international conferences in the above fields. The total number of citations of these papers in Google Scholar is roughly 1,400. I have served as program committee member in numerous national and international conferences, and as conference chair or program committee chair for many times.",
      "One of my research focus is Chinese word segmentation, the most fundamental issue in Chinese information processing. I have proposed some key concepts in word segmentation (such as maximal overlapping segmentation ambiguities, true and pseudo segmentation ambiguities, local and global statistics), and have developed an integrated Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging system, which is able to explore all sorts of knowledge, bigrams of words, parts-of-speech and characters, statistical and structural information of named entities, and local statistics of character strings. I have also tried to extend my experience in Chinese word segmentation to other languages in which word segmentation are need, resulting in an international standard ISO/FDIS 24614-1: Language Resource Management -- Word Segmentation of Written Texts -- Part 1: Basic Concepts and General Principles. I am the only project leader for this ISO standard.",
      "Recently, I have presented an original viewpoint in NLP: NLP based on huge-scale naturally annotated corpora. The basic idea is with Web-scale corpora, natural annotation may help machine better perform some NLP tasks. There are two types of natural annotation: explicit (such as punctuations, anchor text, query log, Wikipedia, blog tags) and implicit (such as language usage patterns). I further put forward a fundamental problem: if we could integrate all information drawn from naturally annotated corpora of different perspectives, are we able to achieve some degree of deep understanding of languages A preliminary work by my students and me published in Computational Linguistics 2009 showed the usefulness of punctuations in Chinese word segmentation, suggesting that this idea deserves further study.",

Supported by National Science Foundation of China, National Basic Research Program (973), National 863 High-Tech Program and Advanced Defensive Research Project, series of research achievements have been achieved in stable neuro-fuzzy adaptive control and robust control of nonlinear systems, and filtering and control of Markovian Jump Systems. Significant achievements are listed as follows:",
      "1. Stable Neuro-Fuzzy Adaptive Control of Nonlinear Systems. I have proposed a novel design idea of neural network-variable structure control. I have also developed systematic design approaches to the sampled-data adaptive control of (rigid/flexible link) robotic manipulators and a class of nonlinear systems. Those theoretical results have been verified by experiments. Representative paper of this research,Neural Network-based Adaptive Controller Design of Robotic Manipulators with an Observer, was awarded the first prize of the 18th Choon-Gang academic awards (Korea) in 2003.",
      "2. Control and Filtering of Multi-Scale Nonlinear Systems and Markov Jump Systems.",
      "A large class of practical plants, including flexible manipulators, flying wing aircrafts, catalytic reduction towers and large flexible space structures, can be described by multiple scale models with small perturbation parameters. I have proposed and proved the existence and sufficiency of approximation of multi-scale nonlinear systems using fuzzy singularly perturbed model (FSPM). I have also indicated the necessary condition of the universal approximator with a given precision. The adaptive and robust control approaches are developed based on both dependent and independent perturbation parameter solutions, which could obtain a significant control precision. Furthermore, effective methods are developed to address the saturation effect and incomplete measurable states in practical systems. I was invited to give a plenary speech in IEEE Intelligent System Design and Applications 2006 on this topic.",
      "3. Application Researches. Since I joined Tsinghua University in 2001, I have supervised 20 master and 15 Ph.D students. Our research are related to some of the most important applications of neuro-fuzzy control methods in rigid and flexible-link manipulators, nonlinear systems, internetworked systems, space robots, etc. As of the experimental verification of our theoretical results, we have constructed two flexible-link robot test-beds and a teleoperation system for space on-orbit services. I have published 2 monographs, and filed 8 patent applications (3 authorized).",

      "Due to the giant volume of Web information and limitations of current intelligent technologies, semantic analysis of on-line data faces lots of challenges. While billions of users are surfing the Web each day by means of direct typing of domain name, hyperlink on existing Web pages, or search engines, it is believed that their behaviors contain certain semantic information, which can be further utilized to help us better understand the semantic meanings of online data. Therefore, we work on this kind of information with the aim of improving the performance of Web search engines.",

      "1. Quantum Complexity Theory.",
      "Quantum interactive proofs form a central area in the theory of quantum algorithm complexity, with important connections to other branches of complexity theory and cryptography. Our research provides a complete characterization of two important complexity classes in this field, QIP and MIP*. Some of the related results have had interdisciplinary impact, addressing important open problems in theoretical physics and pure mathematics.",
      "2. Quantum Cryptography.",
      "Quantum computing is deeply connected to cryptography. In our work on quantum cryptography, we introduce the concept of pseudo-randomness to quantum state space, define the notion of pseudorandom quantum states, and establish their fundamental properties and applications. These results have not only influenced the field of quantum cryptography but have also recently been applied in research on quantum gravity and black holes. We construct quantum zero-knowledge proofs for languages in QMA, the quantum counterpart of NP, and investigate the quantum aspects of zero-knowledge proofs. Additionally, we propose a post-quantum cryptographic assumption based on tensor equivalence and design post-quantum secure digital signature protocols based on this assumption.",
      "3. Quantum Information.",
      "Quantum information theory and quantum entanglement theory form the foundational language of quantum computing. In collaboration with colleagues, we have solved several fundamental problems in quantum information theory and quantum entanglement theory. This includes introducing programmability to quantum channel parameter estimation problems, addressing the sample complexity of quantum state tomography, and answering the LU-LC problem for stabilizer states in the negative.",
      "4. Quantum Software.",
      "Quantum software is a core technology that is equally important as the development of quantum hardware. In collaboration with colleagues, we have proposed and developed the theory of bi-simulation for quantum communication concurrent systems (CCS), the theory of weakest preconditions for quantum programs, and the symbolic representation method for quantum circuits.",

      "Research Overview",
      "Model checking quantum systems: Model checking is an important technique for formal verification of sequential programs, concurrent protocols, and hardware systems. Due to its mechanizability and ability to provide diagnostic information, it has been widely used in industry. We proposed two different quantum Markov chain models and systematically developed model checking methods for linear and branching quantum temporal logic formulas. In 2021, we published Model Checking Quantum Systems: Principles and Algorithms (Cambridge University Press), which systematically reviews this emerging research direction of quantum model checking, especially the work of our research group. This is the first academic monograph in the field of quantum model checking.",
      "Quantum Program Verification: Hoare logic is the logical foundation of program verification and occupies a central position in program design methodology. Hoare logic defines appropriate axioms and inference rules for all program constructs of an imperative programming language, enabling (partial) automated proofs of program correctness. We established Hoare logic for quantum programs with classical variables, proving its soundness and relative completeness. This logic has been used to verify the complete Shor algorithm for the first time (ACM TQC 2021). Recently, we further employed this technique to design Hoare logic systems for quantum parallel programs without shared variables (TCS 2022), distributed quantum programs with classical communication (ACM TOCL 2022), and nondeterministic quantum programs(ASPLOS’23).",
      "Quantum Communicating Systems: Quantum communication and cryptography are currently the most mature technologies in the field of quantum information. In order to formally describe quantum communication networks and lay a theoretical foundation for formal verification of quantum network software and communication protocols, we proposed the quantum process algebra qCCS (Information and Computation 2007). More importantly, we have successfully established a notion of bisimulation for quantum processes and proved its congruence for various process constructs (POPL’11, ACM TOPLAS 2012). Our subsequent works, including symbolic bisimulation (ACM TOCL 2014), open bisimulation (TCS 2012), and distribution-based bisimulation (CONCUR 2015), have greatly enriched the theoretical foundation of qCCS and enhanced its ability to describe and verify practical quantum communicating systems.",

      "I received the B.S. degree from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 1991, respectively. From 1992 to 1994, as a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University, my research interests got involved in fuzzy neural network models, fast BP learning algorithms, and asynchronous learning control. In the end of 1994, I became an Associate Professor at Tsinghua University. From 1996 to 1997, I served as a Research Associate at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China. During that period, I mainly worked on reinforcement learning approaches. From 2001 to 2003, I was a Visiting Professor with Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA, where I took part in DARPA- and NSF-funded projects related to networked embedded system technologies (NEST) and novel ncRNA gene prediction, respectively. Since 2000, I have been a Full Professor with Tsinghua University. So far I have authored or co-authored more than 290 papers and 5 books, including international peer-reviewed academic journals like IEEE TNN，TNNLS，and TITS and top-class international conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, IJCAI, ICPR, ICIP, ECAI, ITSC, IV, ICRA, and IROS.",

In the area of 3D geometric data processing and modeling, I have proposed methods for point cloud denoising based on a generalized metric and optimization of surface mesh quality using anisotropic techniques. In 3D content editing, I have developed an algorithm and tool for segmentation based on Gaussian splatting. For dynamic 3D reconstruction, I have introduced an efficient modeling method based on sparse neural radiance fields. Additionally, in the field of fragment-based 3D reconstruction, I have proposed a deep learning algorithm for fragment assembly based on diffusion models.",

      "My major research areas include computer networking, operating systems, and ubiquitous/pervasive computing. I have led many national and international research projects and industrial projects. In recognition of my distinguished contributions, I won the National Scientific and Technological Progress Award (2nd class) twice in 1998 and 2001, National Technological Invention Award (2nd class) in 2004, as well as 5 provincial or ministerial awards. I also received the Prize of HLHL (Hong Kong) Foundation for Scientific and Technological Progress in 2005. I have filed 18 Chinese and 3 American patents as the first inventor, of which 17 Chinese and 1 American patents have been granted. Accordingly, I won the Top Patent Award of China in 2006. I have published over 180 technical papers on international journals and conferences, and I'm the author (or compiler) of 9 monographs or textbooks. I received IEEE Best Paper Award at the 21st IEEE AINA International Conference in 2007. I have made outstanding contributions to the engineering research and education of computing technology in China, in particular:",
      "1. I have proposed and realized spatio-temporally extended von Neumann architecture-based thin clients, and have transferred this technology into real products, thus winning the National Technological Invention Award (2nd class) in 2004 and IEEE AINA 2007 Best Paper Award. To overcome the weakness (e.g., continuous upgrading, complicated operations, and low security) of traditional computers, I have started some research and implemented a new computing paradigm and platform based on pervasive computing, named Transparent Computing. This paradigm extends the von Neumann computer architecture to separate computation from storage of programs (including operating systems) spatiotemporally. The computation and storage of programs can be carried out by different machines connected by networks. In this way, users can select different operating systems (OSes) to run on the same hardware platform, thus solving the problem of running different big-size OSes and applications on small hardware platforms. These technologies have been transferred to Lenovo Beijing Corporation for real products, which are largely applied in many fields such as military, education, and business. Experts at CMU believed that this research is a very interesting innovation and may have significant implications for the design of future distributed systems.",
      "2. I have put forward several protocol synthesis theories or methods, and achieved a number of innovations in fundamental network theory research. I developed the first network-access router in China with independent intellectual properties, which significantly promoted the theoretical research and industrial development of network in China. I proposed and realized an interactive protocol synthesis method that can predict and prevent logical errors. This method is published on various IEEE transactions, with relevant content selected into Computer Advancement-a book published by American Scientific Publishing House, and is also cited by people in the field as Zhang's Protocol Synthesis Method. The first access router in China, referred to as SED-08, had been successfully industrialized and had been widely deployed in military, government, and other critical departments such as schools and enterprises.",
      "3. I have proposed and implemented an active service method that can provide services to meet the ever-changing demands of users. According to the innovative ideas of software development, I defined the concept, architecture, and implementation framework of active services, and proposed a series of methods for multi-faceted construction, transformation, discovery, reorganization, compilation, and evolution in building software component warehouse. Based on the above-mentioned principles, I designed and implemented the prototype, and applied them to military information systems. The monograph entitled Active Service: Concept, Architecture and Implementation, published by Chinese Science Press and Thomson Learning, was commented by Computer Journal of the United Kingdom as (it) breaks new ground in active services and program mining and is likely to be viewed in retrospect as a milestone in its field.",

      "My research group addresses fundamental problems in all aspects of intelligent process of visual media. The visual media data that my group studied includes images, videos and 3D digital geometry. Here intelligent processing means that we explore and extract the inherent patterns in the visual media, characterize them using appropriate geometric structures (possibly after applying some non-linear feature transformations and dimension reductions), and use these geometric structures to design efficient algorithms that behave like assigning machine intelligence to the computer. As a typical example, my research work Sketch2Photo: Internet Image Montage has been voted as Top 10 Most Promising Digital Initiatives in 2010 by , France (). The research work of my group has been published on ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and The Visual Computer (TVC). These papers have been cited by more than 1200 times.",
      "Another direction of my research is dedicated security-focused operating system and middleware techniques. For reasons of disk economy and efficiency, reducing disk energy consumption and improving disk performance in high-performance computer systems are increasingly pressing issues. To achieve these goals, we define the concept of ISRA (Immediate Successor Relationship Amount) to represent the successor relationship of data blocks, and propose an ISRA-based grouping algorithm for disk reorganization, based on an undirected graph. This work was published in IEEE Transactions on Computers.",

The review article published in the same issue believed that our work proposed a “breakthrough solution” for the tightly coupling problem of brain-inspired computing. It is the first Nature paper in the field of computer architecture in China. The related work was applied to the National Scientific and Technological Achievement Exhibition of “13thFive Year”.

      "My research has mainly focused on cloud computing, big data storage and processing in recent years, with the following results achieved:",
      "1. For cloud computing, targeting issues with cluster such as monotonous usage mode, limited application types support, and management complexity, I put forward a new virtualization model for multiple computing resources, which can support customization and auto deployment at the levels of hardware, operating system and applications, and developed a virtual computing system accordingly. In addition, I proposed a deduplication-based virtual machine (VM) image storage and transfer method that can both reduce space consumption and boost image distribution, and presented an approach for fast live cross-datacenter VM migration.",
      "2. For big data storage, I devised a method to combine SSD (solid state drive) and HDD (hard disk drive) to meet the requirements of big data processing and showed how to use it to accelerate MapReduce execution. Also, I studied the issues of cloud-based data storage and sharing, and co-developed MeePo, a high available cloud storage system that had been applied to China Unicom Guangdong Branch, Huawei, ZTE, CNPC, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and so on, serving more than 1.5 million registered users and 6000 enrolled communities in total, and that won the State Technological Invention Award, 2ndclass in 2015.",
      "3. For big data processing, to deal with MapReduce performance degradation on heterogeneous clusters, I put forward ActCap, a method that reduces inter-node data transfer (key cause of performance degradation) by node-capability-aware data placement; to improve MapReduce with skewed input data, I devised Skew--, a coordinated systematic solution that adopts complexity-aware keys assignment, a post-Map keys allocation scheme taking into account not only the number of keys, but also the Reduce task complexity and the key group size to balance the loads among Reducers, and other data locality and resource scheduling enhanced mechanisms to guarantee the benefit of post-Map keys allocation. ActCap can gain an average speedup of 49.8% over standard Hadoop YARN and 9.8% over Tarazu, whereas Skew-- can get an average speedup of 1.98x over standard Hadoop YARN, and 1.63x, 1.77x, and 1.41x (Reduce phase only) over SkewTune, Online Balancer, and TopCluster respectively.",

Zhang from CAF) and I have been working on applying the theories and technologies of grid/distributed computing to the Earth Observation and Navigation domain. Contributions of our research include:",
      "1. We proposed architecture for Spatial Information Grid (SIG), developed a runtime environment of SIG, and created the world's first SIG prototype in 2003.",
      "2. To improve the flexibility of SIG services, we proposed an on-demand service mechanism, which outperforms traditional mechanism in mass-data processing. We have also researched on context-centric application automation methods for easier and quicker SIG application development. Our method automatically executes the procedures of situation acquirement, processing, and matching, and then generates a situational SIG application without any input from developers.",
      "3. For the purposes of resource sharing and application execution, a series of SIG middleware have been developed, including SIG Container and SIG Runtime Environment (SIGRE). We have also designed and developed SIG Application Engine to provide runtime support and web-based user interfaces.",
      "4. To address the issues of managing and distributing remote sensing data from multiple sources, we have designed and implemented a SIG-based distribution system, which dispatches remote sensing data from different sources and of different types and formats, and provides a one-stop on-demand service for data consumers.",
      "5. We have been actively pushing our work to real application domains. Our first SIG prototype has drawn great attentions from international practitioners when presented in WGISS 2003. During 5.12 Sichuan earthquake in 2008, our SIG technologies were used to efficiently set up a remote sensing data distribution system from multiple sources such as USGS and ESA. Besides, our research on SIG has also been used in areas of forestry resource management, flood monitoring, and disaster response.",

      "I conduct research on novel processor microarchitectures and the fundamental hardware / software of neuromorphic computing. Addressing the issues of ambiguous hierarchical interfaces and tight hardware-software coupling in neuromorphic computing systems due to the lack of a comprehensive theoretical foundation, we proposed the neuromorphic computing completeness inspired by the computational characteristics of neural networks, as well as a decoupled hardware-software hierarchy for neuromorphic computers and basic hardware primitives based on this completeness. It is demonstrated that such systems can support general-purpose computation, hardware completeness, and compilation feasibility for neuromorphic computing. These research findings have been applied to the development of the TianjiC neuromorphic chip, which targets artificial general intelligence, resolving the key issue of toolchain support for the fusion of heterogeneous networks. Based on these results, we designed a RISC-like neuromorphic chip and basic software that efficiently supports such hardware primitives, significantly enhancing performance. Subsequently, I proposed the design of a general-purpose neuromorphic computing chip and system, and leveraged the advantages of neuromorphic architecture to benefit general-purpose processors by designing a heterogeneous processor that integrates the strengths of neuromorphic architecture for general and sparse computing. This processor successfully underwent experimental tape-out in 2022 and 2025.",
      "The paper on neuromorphic computing completeness was published in Nature (October 2020), marking the first Nature paper in the field of computer system architecture in China. It was recognized as a featured outcome at the 2020 World Internet Conference and one of the top ten global AI advancements by the BAAI (Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence). The TianjiC chip paper was published as a cover article in Nature (August 1, 2019), the first Nature paper in China's AI and chip fields, and was selected as one of China's top ten scientific advancements in 2019 and a leading scientific achievement at the 2019 World Internet Conference.

      "Xuehai Qian’s research focuses on parallel computer architecture, hardware/software co-designed domain-specific architectures and systems for graph analytics and machine learning, hardware security and quantum computer architecture. In parallel computer architecture area, he proposed the first scalable cache coherence protocols for atomic block execution, which can be leveraged to implement high performance sequential consistency for multiprocessors. He proposed the first hardware precise sequential consistency violation detection scheme and applied the ideas in deterministic record and replay for any relaxed memory consistency models, a well-known open problem in computer architecture community. In domain-specific architectures and systems for graph analytics, he proposed various architectures for graph processing leveraging emerging memory technology (e.g., processing-in-memory, ReRAM) to reduce and optimize data movements; he also proposed several novel distributed frameworks to optimize communication between distributed computing nodes and a specialized compiler to support advanced graph pattern mining algorithms. For machine learning, he proposed efficient synchronous and asynchronous protocols for decentralized training; with collaborators, developed several accelerator architectures with algorithm, architecture, and hardware technology co-design.",

I have published over 120 papers in IEEE TPDS, IEEE TVLSI, MICRO, etc., authorized 12 invention patents, formulated more than 30 standards, and authored 4 works. In terms of multi-core processor design, I have proposed various high computing unit utilization compilation optimization techniques and core mapping scheduling methods for VLIW multi-core stream architecture and perception of computing unit utilization, which can optimize the utilization of core computing units, significantly improve processor performance, reduce processor power consumption, and solve the technical problem of high-performance and low-power compilation optimization for multi-core processors based on network on chip. In terms of parallel programming and compilation optimization, I have proposed a multi task collaborative development method based on micro kernels and computing array engines. For the first time, a configurable software development tool for heterogeneous multi-core architecture has been implemented, solving technical challenges such as heterogeneous multi-core communication, distributed memory management, and cross core task scheduling. In terms of intelligent processor architecture, I have proposed a new type of ReRAM based LSTM accelerator architecture. By using neural network approximators to achieve vector computation in LSTM, multiple functional units in the system have a consistent architecture, optimizing hardware overhead for analog-to-digital and analog-to-digital conversion, and improving system computational efficiency.",

      "My research interest is parallel computing. In particular, I try to solve the problems of programming wall, memory wall, debugging wall and availability wall we face in parallel computing. In the recent two years, I have also been interested in mobile computing. My research in mobile computing aims at using cloud to manage operating systems, applications and data of mobile devices, and address the reliability, power and network bandwidth issues of current mobile computing platforms.",
      "My research team has proposed a highly effective and low-cost technique which can be used to predict the performance of a high-performance computer early in the design phase. This technique is an elegant combination of compiler techniques, deterministic replay techniques and a high-fidelity trace-driven MPI simulator. In the area of compiler techniques, we investigate a new generation of iterative compilation techniques by employing feedbacks of production applications provided by hardware performance counters. Our idea significantly reduces the overhead of traditional feedback-based optimization approaches.",
      "We have extensive collaborations with major industry companies on the above research areas. One of our research results, the MPI process placement optimization techniques, has filed a U.S. patent by Intel.",
