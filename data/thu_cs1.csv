Since 1986, I have been working on the interconnect analysis and optimization, P/G network design, low-power physical design, and DFM driven layout optimization. At present, our group is developing systems and tools to implement and optimize the physical design of larger-scale integrated circuits.,In the area of P/G network IR-drop noise analysis and Decap optimization, I have proposed several approaches to simulating and optimizing P/G networks. These GPU-based approaches use parallel computing methods to achieve fast and accurate simulation results for large-scale P/G networks. Related papers are published in international conferences such as ICCAD, DAC and ISPD, one of which has been nominated as DAC2009 Best Paper.,In the area of low-power physical designs, I have proposed some novel power/clock gating optimization processes/algorithms, which take trade-offs between timing delay and power in consideration to promote fast convergence of high performance and low power complex designs. Related papers are published in international conference ISPD and IEEE Trans. on VLSI.,In the area of manufacturing (DFM) driven algorithm design, my research group has, in collaboration with Synopsys Inc., proposed an efficient process-hotspot detection algorithm using range pattern matching.

My research areas are Semantic Web and Semantic Web Services, and text and social network mining. Currently, my research focuses on studying key technologies in semantic content management, and applying them in the domains of news, social networks, and web services. I have published about 90 papers in international journals and conferences including SIGIR, SIGMOD, SIGKDD, ISWC, CIKM, JoDS, JoWS etc.,1. Ontology-based semantic content management. In semantic content management, ontology matching and semantic annotation are our main research topics. In ontology matching, we proposed a Bayes decision-based ontology matching framework, and further proposed a dynamic ontology matching framework to solve the aggregation problem of different matching methods for difference matching tasks. Our related work has been published in many papers such as JoWS, TKDE, and SIGMOD, and the citation number of our JoWS paper by Google Scholar is 73. In semantic annotation, we have developed three models to annotate different kinds of resources with different characteristics, including rule-based model named iASA, an SVM classification-based method, and a CRFs-based model. These models have been applied in different annotation tasks such as research profiling, stock annual report extraction, and conference annotation. The above work is funded by NSFC and National 973 Basic Research Program.,2. News and Social Network Mining. In news mining, we proposed index tree and name entity-based topic detection and tracking method, and further proposed a topic-based news exploration framework. This research is published in SIGIR 2007 and demoed in SIGKDD 2009. In social network mining, we proposed an expertise-oriented social network search framework, which has been used in a practical academic social network mining system-Arnetminer. We have also studied the problems of expert finding, conference mining, and research interest finding.,3. XML application in news domain. I am the fourth author of China Standard ""Chinese News Markup Language (CNML)"" (GB/T20092-2006), and the PI for the project named CNML Management System. This software has been applied in many business systems of Xinhua News Agency, such as text, image and multimedia editing systems.

These courses span from fundamental database theory, database design, (advanced) distributed multimedia databases, secure data management, object-oriented programming paradigm, data structure and algorithm, information system development, operating systems, frontier software technologies to computer programming for non-majors.,During the past 3 years, my major teaching efforts were spent on the 1st year bachelor course on programming fundamentals which is open to all the university students. I believe that computing education for non-majors must be distinguished from that for computing-major students. Students in these classes are from diverse backgrounds and are heading on diverse directions. They work with entities (e.g., signals, images, equations, tables of data, etc.) , and have different thoughts about computing. Many times they think of computers as a tool rather than an object of intrinsic interest. Computation is not their primary interest or career goal, and often very limited time is devoted to their formal study of computation.,According to these characteristics of the students and their requirements on the course, in my teaching, I pick up examples which are accessible at an intuitive level by different kinds of students, or those in their working domains. To let the course be directly useful, the course materials guide the students how to represent and operate on diverse entities in their domains rather than focus on abstract complex data structures like AVL trees. Overall, the course teaching aims to introduce to the students the fundamental programming methodology, and meanwhile empower the students with a strong intuition regarding the power of computing, what computers can do, and what computers cannot.,Research Status,Research Status,I have been in the area of data management for over 30 years. My research interests include context-aware secure data management towards Ambient Intelligence, data mining and warehousing, and distributed object-oriented database management systems, etc. As a principal investigator, co-principal investigator, or key project member, I have undertaken over 30 national and international projects in the Mainland of China, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and Australia, and published over 200 scientific articles in high-quality international conferences or journals (including ACM TOIS, IEEE TKDE, J. VLDB, J-BHI, etc.).,One of my work in secure data management was patented by the Royal Philips in theNetherlandsdue to its innovation and applicability in 2003.The key contribution that I made in the area of data mining is to extend the work on association rule analysis from intra transactional analysis to inter transactional analysis. This is of particular significance when one is looking at forecasting systems. This is the first work which has done this kind of extension. In the area of data warehouses, I provided explanatory semantics for data warehouses using linguistic representations and fuzzy reasoning. In the area of XML databases, I developed techniques which do transformation of object oriented systems as well as a conceptual graph approach to the design of XML documents. I once proposed a context-aware data management and service paradigm towards Ambient Intelligence, which has raised a number of challenging issues in the next-generation mobile intelligent data management field. This work received the NWO VIDI Vernieuwingsimpuls (innovational) outstanding individual prize, awarded by the Dutch Organization of Scientific Research, which is the most prestigious award given to outstanding researchers in the Neterlands, and I was the first winner from the IT field since the setting up of this award in 2000.,The research work on integrating social media and daily activities to sense, predict, alert, and ease teens stress has led to a new computational mental healthcare direction.,Research Projects,Ministry of Science and Technology Key Research and Development Grant: Big Data Management System for Advanced Manufacturing (2016-2019);,The National Natural Science Foundation of China：A Micro-blog Platform for Sensing and Easing Adolescent Psychological Pressures (2014-2017);,Ministry of Science and Technology Major Project：Unstructured Data Management System (2010-2011);,Tsinghua-Boeing Joint Research Center Research Grant: Ambient Smart and Context-Aware Data Management for Aviation Service（2010-2011）;,The National Natural Science Foundation of China：Sensor Data Management: Theoretic Foundation and Implementation Techniques (2011-2013);,Nokia-China Joint Research Fund: Scalable Architecture and Systems for Context-Aware Mobile Services (2009-2011);,The National Natural Science Foundation of China：Context-Aware Data Management Technology (2008-2010);,The National High-Tech R&D Program ofChina(The 863 Program): Key Techniques and Prototype Systems for Building Smart Spaces (2008-2010);,Dutch Organization of Scientific Research (NWO - Innovative Research Grant, TheNetherlands): Towards Context-Aware Data Management for Ambient Intelligence (2005-2010).,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,Ministry of Education, The People's Republic ofChina: ChangJiang Professorship Award (2007);,Tsinghua University: Hundred-Talents Award (2006);,Tsinghua University: 《Fundamentals of Computer Programming》Course Revolution and Innovation Construction，Teaching Achievement Award, 2nd Class (2009).,Ministry of Education, The People's Republic ofChina: SQL-based Standard Relational Database Management System ADB, Award for Science and Technology Progress, 1st Class (1993);,Dutch Organization of Scientific Research, The Netherlands: NWO VIDI Vernieuwingsimpuls (innovational) outstanding individual award (2004);,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Hongjun Lu, Ling Feng, and Jiawei Han.

Before joining Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, I worked at Intel China Research Center where I did some research on data streaming in the grid environment. I have also worked on Chinese natural language processing while I was doing research at City University in Hong Kong between 2001 and 2002.,We have built a system which uses virtual machines to form virtual clusters, so that users and applications can be provided with customized environment such as tailored operating systems and specified application environment. I have also done some work on distributed data processing. By using transparent data streaming mode, traditional applications that use file system for data storing can be coupled together in a network environment. In the area of Chinese natural language processing, we have proposed a method using character count of substring accessors (predecessors and successors). The larger the count value, the more likely the substring is a word. In this way, words can be extracted from a collection of raw text.,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Haodi Feng, Kang Chen, Xiaotie Deng, Weimin Zheng, Accessor Variety Criteria for Chinese Word Extraction, Computational Linguistics, Volume 30, Number 1, 1 March 2004, pp. 75-93(19),[2] Kang Chen, Meiming Shen, Weimin Zheng.

It spans across most of my works, from algorithmic game theory to distributed ledgers. Indeed, compared to computer systems from many decades ago, where each computer ran individually to execute single-machine programs, today’s computer systems and networks often have more than one participant interact in a distributed environment. E-commerce, social networks, and multi-robot systems are all handy examples, among many others. The participants include both human beings and artificial intelligence, and their objectives in the same system may vary from one to another. Often, by making individual decisions and taking individual actions, they collectively make progress and achieve the system’s goal set forth by its designer, such as social efficiency, global consensus, etc. My research is to design such systems and characterize their behavior using rigorous theory, so that individual decision-making leads the system towards its global goal, not only efficiently, but also securely and robustly under adversarial environments.,Honors and Awards,NSF CAREER Award, 2016,Publications,1.Bayesian Auctions with Efficient Queries.J.

As service-oriented computing (SOC) becomes the new computing paradigm of the Internet, it is a big necessity to automatically combine some web services in a certain way to satisfy specific requirements. My research achieved remarkable improvement on efficiency of automatic service composition.,My research group observes the data correlations between services' outputs and inputs. In existing works, data correlations are usually expressed in an implicit and automatic way by reasoning on data models or ontology models used in service definitions. My group proposes to express data correlations by explicit declarations. Referring to the fundamental idea of hyperlinks, the Service Data Link model (SDL) is proposed to explicitly declare data correlations among services. Furthermore, my group combines the expressive power of the SDL model with the Service Dependency Graph model (SDG), and present SDG+, an extended version of SDG, which introduces three extensions: 1) attribute quantifier, 2) attribute transform, and 3) explicit dependency. Taking advantage of explicit dependency, a major extension of SDG+, my group developed a composition algorithm for IEEE CEC Web Service Challenge 2007, which significantly improved the performance in dealing with datasets that contain complex inheritances among message types. The system designed based on this algorithm won the championship of Performance Evaluation in the competition.,In our research of automatic composition problem of QoS-aware and non-predefined workflow, a theoretical data-driven and QoS-optimized service composition model is proposed. In order to acquire composition solutions with optimal end-to-end QoS, my group utilize the semantic information among data types to realize semantic matching in service composition, and have proposed two composition algorithms. One is based on iterative generation, which iteratively searches services and updates the optimal QoS values; the other is based on greedy procedure which always selects the services with optimal accumulated QoS values. The experiment results show that the two algorithms are able to solve the problem correctly and satisfy the efficiency requirement of runtime systems. The system designed based on these two algorithms won the first place team and first runner-up team of Performance Evaluation in IEEE CEC Web Service Challenge 2008 and 2009.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,Science and Technology Progress Award by City of Beijing, Second Class-Automatic E-Form Generation System and its Visualization Tools (2001);,IEEE CEC/EEE Web Service Challenge: First Place Team (2006-2008);,IEEE CEC/EEE Web Service Challenge: First Runner-up Team (2009);,Student Research Training (SRT) Program of Tsinghua University: Outstanding Supervisor Award, First Class (2007);,Tsinghua University Outstanding Teaching Award, Second Class-Java Programming by using NetBeans (2008);,Tsinghua University Excellent Textbook Award, Second Class-Java Programming Language Fundamentals (2008);,Beijing Excellent Higher-Education Textbook Award-Java Programming Language Application Development (2008);,Sun Microsystems: Java Champion (2005).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Z.F.

Currently I am also developing a simulator which is able to evaluate memory sub-systems quantitatively.,Our simulator, called TSIM (Tsinghua SIMulator), is a fast and cycle-accurate memory sub-system modeling and evaluating framework for Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs). This simulator provides a flexible and extensible approach to evaluating architecture designs, models, and algorithms, including network-on-chip interconnection, cache hardware pre-fetcher, memory system protocol, replacement policy, etc.,TSIM tries to balance among speed, accuracy and flexibility. By introducing the concept of statistical metamerics, TSIM separates the analysis stage from the simulation process. This provides a great facilitation for users to sample and analyze the performance metrics. More significantly, TSIM focuses on CMP systems and supports multithread workloads.

I develop systems and tools to optimize the physical layout and logical design of integrated circuits (ICs). I am also working on the algorithms for combinatorial optimization and stochastic optimization. As a research associate, I visited Prof. Jason Cong's group in UCLA in 2005. During one year's stay in UCLA, I developed ""3D MEVA"", an evaluation model for micro-architecture of 3D ICs. Recently, I've been leading several projects on 3D ICs. Related papers are published on top conferences such as ICCAD, DAC, ASPDAC, etc.,In recent years, I have proposed several approaches to optimizing the physical design process of 2D and 3D ICs, which integrate various constraints such as timing, layout and power. To achieve efficient optimization of multiple objectives with complex constraints, an analytical optimization approach simulating the appealing and repelling force model is proposed for 3D ICs' packing process. In addition, I also proposed a novel incremental optimization process and its associated algorithms, which are helpful to the fast convergence of the complex designs.,Most of my work aims at optimizing the design process of IC layout to improve its performance, reliability and cost efficiency. This topic lies between CS and EE, and I have been collaborating with several professors in both areas, investigating ways to improve the electronic design ability, as well as the algorithms in computer science.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,ASICON 2007: Best Paper Award (2007).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Yuchun Ma, Xin Li, Yu Wang and Xianlong Hong.

Realization of High-Performance IPv4/v6 Router Architecture,As a beginner in China of high-performance routers research, I have presided over many national programs relating to the research of high-performance IPv4/v6 routers. Our development of high-performance IPv6 routers began in 2000, and succeeded in 2004. In the R&D of routers, I was in charge of the design and development of hardware architecture and system, proposing a series of key technologies in router hardware including self-adaptive allocation method in large-scale dual-stack routing table, hardware redundancy method, high-speed switching technology, high-speed serial transmission technology, and hardware dual-stack wire-speed forwarding engine. They are capable of addressing the design and implementation of computing processing plane, network switching plane, high-speed serial backplane, 10G line cards, 2.5G line card, gigabit Ethernet line cards, system electromagnetic shielding, and ventilation of system routing.,Our IPv6 Core Router passed the Network Access Test organized by Ministry of Information Industry, becoming the first equipment passing this high-end network accessing test. It was also appraised by Ministry of Information Industry in May 2004, and the comments acquired regarding hardware design and implementation are as follows: ""Key technologies such as routing table allocation method by dynamic self-adaptive dual-stack forwarding engines, and hardware redundancy method, realize major innovations. Among them, dual-stack mixed routing table technology has reached international leading level."",2. Scalable Switching Network and Reconfigurable Routers,I have engaged in the research of key technologies of scalable router architectures for a long time. My focus is hardware structure of scalable routers, which has issues including switching network structure of scalable routers, routing structure and strategies of scalable routers, and QoS issues of scalable routers.,1) Switching Network Architecture of Scalable Routers. At present, almost all core routers in the world adopt Cross Bar switching structure. Its hardware complexity is O(n2) and its scalability complexity is high. Therefore, switching networks of core routers all have this scalability issue. I proposed a switching network architecture namedH-Torus, which is applicable to scalable routers by combining and improving 3D-Torus and cellular structure. Its hardware complexity is reduced to O (n), which has good scalability and switching performance.,2) Routing Structure and Strategies of Scalable Routers. Due to the length difference of IPv6 and IPv4 addresses, the design and lookup method of dual-stack mixed routing table are design challenges of core routers and scalable routers. International companies such as Cisco and Juniper adopt independent IPv6/Ipv4 routing tables. I proposed a dynamic self-adaptive routing table allocation method for IPv6/v4 dual-stack forwarding engine. This method dynamically allocates the content of IPv6 and IPv4 routing table, solving the dual-stack mixed lookup issue. Besides, it supports dynamic allocation of IPv6/v4 routing table in the same physical system. Fast routing lookup can be achieved based on the flexible allocation of IPv6/IPv4 routing table numbers. This method improves the forwarding speed of routers, and has been successfully applied to core routers.,3) QoS Issue of Scalable Routers. QoS control/guarantee is end-to-end behavior. Being one of the key issues, network equipment supporting QoS control is the basis of the whole network QoS. I proposed a multi-constraint QoS routing structure and caching management mechanism. The mechanism solves the linear increase issue of QoS routing tables, and reduces both time and space complexity of routing lookup algorithm.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,China Youth Science and Technology Award (2010);,Science and Technology Progress Award by China Communications Standards Association(CCSA), First Class-IPv6 Core Router (2004);,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-IPv6 Core Router (2005);,China Computer Federation: Wang Xuan Award, First Class-IPv6 Core Router (2006).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Ruisheng Wang;Youjian Zhao; Hongtao Guan; Guanghui Yang.

My research areas are mainly in next generation Internet protocol test based on formal methods, large-scale IPv6 network test, and Internet large-scale addressing and routing three aspects.,1. In the research on formal methods based next generation Internet, my group proposed routing and robust test related theories and algorithms, designed a comprehensive set of next generation Internet IPv6 core protocol cases, and developed TTCN-3 based next generation Internet protocol integrated test system (PITS), making contributions for domestic IPv6 core router development.,In the research of next generation Internet protocol test theory, we proposed dynamic threshold based BGP routing protocol real-time test theory and algorithm, inter domain routing convergence time algorithm combined with autonomous system hierarchy, robustness test algorithm combined with time constraints, communication multi-port finite state machine based protocol interoperability test generation algorithm etc. The self-designed whole set of routing protocols include IPv6 core protocols, address related protocols, transition protocols, and routing protocols etc., which have no precedent public report internationally. Besides, we developed TTCN-3 based next generation Internet protocol integrated test system (PITS). In developing domestic IPv6 core routers, we tested all the protocol realization, accelerating the development, and guaranteed the research and development quality using the above theories and algorithms, the whole unit of IPv6 protocol test cases, and the protocol integrated test system. The IPv6 core router we developed takes the lead in passing the Internet accessing test hold by the Ministry of Information Industry, and is widespread in China next generation Internet demonstrative project CNGI. It won the 1st class technological award of China Institute of Communications and major invention award of the Ministry of Information Industry in 2004, and the 2nd class national technological progress award in 2005.,2. In the research on large-scale IPv6 network test, we proposed large-scale pure IPv6 network interoperability, function, and performance test machine and scheme. I presided over the design of all test cases, comprehensively tested the function, performance, and multi-vendor equipment interoperability, playing an important role in CNGI-CERNET2/6IX development.,CNGI core network CNGI-CERNET/6IX is the largest trial network in CNGI project, and also the first pure IPv6 large-scale network in the world. It connects 25 core nodes of 20 cities throughout China and all IPv6 test network in the world with high speed and almost covers all types of IPv6 core routers. The interoperability, function, and performance test are complex, and critical to the system development. We proposed a distributed, synchronized-ordination and multi-coordination joint large-scale test model and scheme of pure IPv6 network without any precedent to learn from. The model is made according to test need, and combines with self-developed test equipment and advantages of various test devices. Besides, it integrates interoperability, function and performance test features. Based on the model, we designed a great number of test cases, relative completely test the multi-vendor interoperability, network function, and performance indicators and parameters. Thereby system development progress is sped up and network debug difficulties are simplified, playing a key role in promoting the system as a whole to world leading level. The project won the 1st class Science and Technology Progress Award of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Progress Award in 2006 and 2nd class National Science and Technology Progress Award in 2007.,3. In the research on next generation Internet large-scale addressing and routing technology, we proposed PI and PA separation based scalable addressing and routing architecture, and designed relative algorithms and technical solutions, achieving initial results.,In the recent two years, aiming at large-scale scalable addressing and routing selection issues in the next generation Internet, we determined the real IPv6 source address authentication based next generation Internet large-scale addressing and routing selection strategy.

My main research achievements are as follows:,1. Research on the Scalable and Reconfigurable High-performance Routing and Switching Technology.,This research presents a BGP implementing model based on the scalable routing and switching System, which has a higher speedup ratio compared with that of the previous proposals.,It proposes the function module division and system development method at three levels – sub-component, component and macro-component – based on the characteristic of routing and switching software. Compared with other methods, this one raises the code reuse proportion and efficiently reduces the routing system development cost. From this research, six patents of invention have been granted.,The scalable and reconfigurable high-performance router software platform has better compatibility, and provides developing and testing tools with higher performance efficiency compared with Cisco IOS system and MIT Click platform, respectively. The result helped win the Science and Technology of Electronic Information Award by the Chinese Institute of Electronics (first class) in 2012.,This software platform has been applied to routers of Bitway Networking Technology Co., Ltd., and adopted by network operators, such as CERNET2, China Telecom, and China Mobile, realizing desirable economic and social achievements. Many communication companies have also adopted this software when developing products or testing performance, including H3C, Ruijie Networks and Maipu Communication Technology Practical application by these companies shows “the application of this platform greatly improves development efficiency and accelerates research progress.”,2. Research on P2P Network Traffic Classification & Management and Live Streaming Technology.,This research proposes a new P2P network traffic estimation model, which possesses higher estimation accuracy than the recently proposed gravity and independent connection model. A P2P network traffic classification method is proposed based on P2P networks’ transmission behavior. This method has a simpler approach to classification with a higher success rate than the best result of previous classification methods proposed based on the Bayes’ Theorem. The paper has been cited for ten times since it was published in Computer Communications. A cache replacement algorithm based on P2P network live streaming media is proposed; it has higher cache efficiency than the previous representative cache method based on segments.,A node selection and a transmission scheduling method based on P2P network live streaming media are proposed, solving the problem that the traditional random selection method can hardly guarantee the transmission quality of streaming media and being granted two patents of invention. Based on this achievement, Prof. Xu’s group and PPLive cooperated to develop and implement the cross-platform P2P video accelerator, PPVA. According to the measurement and statistics of the PPVA website, there have been 280 million times of downloading this software, which supports thousands of video web sites invisibly with more than 10 million on-line users downloading videos every day, effectively saving the network broad-band of video web sites and network operators.,3. Research on Internet Traffic Management.,Network multipath traffic management and optimal traffic engineering are studied based on Network Utility Maximization (NUM) theory, which leads to the multipath traffic management method based on the logarithmic barrier method. The multipath traffic management method can realize theory optimization and convergence assurance simultaneously that the previous representatives, including TRUMP, can’t achieve.,A new load balancing in proportion method based on traffic engineering is proposed, getting a new conclusion that the optimal routing in load balancing in proportion is the routing with the shortest M/M/1 queuing delay. Based on this conclusion, the optimal traffic engineering can be realized through routing protocols designed to find the shortest path, such as OSPF, in network engineering.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,The Talent Award by China Venture Investment Corporation Software Engineering (2012),The Young Scientist Award by China Computer Federation(2011),Nova Program of Science and Technology by City of Beijing (2007);,Ministry of Education: New-Century Talents Award (2008);,Science and Technology Progress Award by China Institute of Communications, First Class-IPv6 Core Router (2004);,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-IPv6 Core Router (2005);,China Computer Federation: Wang Xuan Award, First Class-IPv6 Core Router (2006);,Annual China University-Wide Top-Ten Science and Technology Achievement Award-RFC 5210, International Standard of Key Technologies in Next-Generation Internet (2008).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,1.

Being an advanced computer network that covers the whole country, its technology has reached international advanced level of the 90s. It was awarded second-class National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 1997. In this project, I put forward a large-scale Internet architecture design scheme which contains the core ideas of connectionless packet switching, flow-based sub-regional routing and accounting, a large-scale Internet operation and management system based on the technologies of running flow active network element and data link dynamic acquisition, and a security system based on cycle-based security view. I have been responsible for the technical work of CERNET for a long period and presided over the completion of six major national projects. CERNET now has become the world's largest national academic network, which played an important role in accelerating the technological progress of China's Internet and promoting the use and training of it.,2. I have long been engaged in the research of computer network routing and switching technologies. I presided over the development of IPv6 core router. The success of the IPv6 core router is a major breakthrough of key network technologies, and it promoted the localization process of key network equipment development in China. In the 1980s, in the severe situation of the restrictions on Chinese imports of foreign network equipment, I have successful presided over the developments of many key network equipment such as X.25 packet switching network and routing device, advanced network processor and high-performance security router, and promoted the use of these equipment in real networks. Core router is the heart of the Internet. It includes complicated technologies and only the United States, Japan and other technologically advanced countries master its core technology at that time. China's Internet formerly relied on foreign routers, which brought a significant risk to national security. In 2004, I worked with my colleagues and finished the development of IPv6 Core Router with independent intellectual properties. It is the first internal router that passed the IPv6 Core Router Test Specification (Draft) test by Ministry of Information Industry. Its overall technology has reached international advanced and domestic leading level, and it has four important innovations including the scalable router operating system BWOS. Its mixed IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack routing table method and new methods for establishing IPv4overIPv6 tunnel are in the leading positions in the world. This research result was awarded the second-class National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 2005. It gained five national invention patents, and has been widely used in network projects such as CNGI (China Next Generation Internet) program.,3. I have long been engaged in the research of Internet architecture and protocol theory, and key technologies of Internet, and have made some innovative research results. In the 1980s, I proposed the theory of protocol conformance test systems based on expanded labeled transition system, developed a TCP/IP protocol conformance test system to effectively test the Internet protocols. In 2003, I was hired as the chief scientist of the National 973 Project ""Theoretical Study on a New Generation Internet"", and led project team to work hard and achieve a number of innovative research results, such as a new Internet architecture which has multi-dimension scalabilities in aspects of scale, function, performance, security and service. I put forward the roadmap of ""Constructing the Large-scale Pure IPv6 Internet Backbone"", which aims to address the technical problems of large-scale IPv6 backbone such as network topology and routing design, addressing and naming planning, network measurement and management. I also put forward an ""IPv4overIPv6 Transition"" theory, which used inexplicit tunneling technology to solve the technical problems such as IPv4 and IPv6 compatibility, transmission mapping, manageability, scalability, security and auto-configuration. I proposed an ""Authentic IPv6 Source Address Architecture"" which has become one of the important technical foundations of trusted next generation Internet. The above results have applied for 11 Chinese patents (3 authorized), promoted the Internet standards organization IETF to set up Softwire and SAVI working groups, and submitted 10 IETF draft standards and 1 CCSA standard. I am the first author of RFC 5210, RFC 5565 and RFC 5747.,4. I presided over the major national projects CNGI-CERNET2/6IX, which improved China's next generation Internet technologies to the international competitive position. I started next generation Internet research in 1998 and presided over the NSFCNET project in 2000, which achieved 10Gbps high-speed IPv6 testbed for the first time in China using IP/DWDM technology, and are able to connect to the international Next Generation Internet. In 2003, I presided over the ""China Next Generation Internet core network CNGI-CERNET2/6IX"" project by uniting 25 universities. This project is currently the world's largest pure IPv6 Internet backbone. It designed and constructed a large-scale next generation Internet backbone mainly based on domestic equipments, which has a major impact both domestically and internationally. It has a number of major innovations which includes: building large-scale pure IPv6 Internet backbone, authentic IPv6 source address architecture, and IPv4overIPv6 transitional technology. They are all international initiatives and reached world leading level. This project strongly promoted China's core network device industrialization and made an important contribution to China's participation in international Next Generation Internet test bed. In this project, I proposed a technology roadmap for ""building a large-scale pure IPv6 Internet backbone"", a major strategy of ""mainly using domestic core IPv6 routers to construct large-scale backbone"", and key technologies of ""authentic IPv6 source address architecture"" and ""IPv4overIPv6 transitional theory"". This project has major impacts on international academic community. The results were awarded Second National Awards for Progress in Science and Technology in 2007 and rated as ""Top Ten Scientific and Technological Progress of China"" in 2004 and 2006.,5. I have long been active in Internet area. I was the APAN Vice-Chairman since 1999 and was elected as Chairman of APAN in 2008. I was awarded as China's Top Ten Scientific and Technological Excellence by IEEE Spectrum in 2005 and gained ""IPv6 Pioneer Award"" by IPv6 Forum in 2007.

Traffic Control in Computer Networks. Many factors throw obstacles in building a refined dynamic model for transport subsystem in computer networks, such as diversity of traffic statistical distribution, nonlinear coupling imposed by protocols, and time-varying characteristics of network states. Although heuristic algorithms for traffic control can be obtained without the support of system model, they can only work normally under some special environments. Through limited simulations (even experiments), the comprehensive evaluation on performance of these heuristic algorithms is difficult to be conducted, and in-depth understanding and sensible insights are hardly to be obtained. In our work in this area, the network traffic control subsystem will be considered as a nonlinear time-varying delay closed-loop system. Using some proper approximation techniques, such as fluid flow and local linearization, the transport subsystems in computer networks are described by linear differential equations. Combining with these coarse-grained models, the classical analysis approaches in linear and nonlinear control theory, such as describing function, phase plane and Lyapunov function, are used to analyze the stability of typical transport subsystems in computer networks, including TCP/AQM, ATM/FECI, Ethernet/BCN, etc. The explicit criterions of system stability are deduced, which provide some valuable guidelines to parameter settings for stable network operation. Otherwise, these theoretical results also give a reasonable interpretation of some phenomena occurring in transport subsystem. For example, the queue oscillation with identical amplitude should be limit cycle caused by the nonlinear elements embedded into traffic control algorithms. On the other hand, borrowing population ecology evolution theory and utilizing the design techniques in robust control theory, such as internal model control, sliding mode variable structure control and fuzzy control, we develop a series of flow control and congestion control algorithms for heterogeneous computer networks, including ultra-high-speed, large delay, mobile and wireless networks.,2. Wireless Sensor Network Architecture and Protocols Design. The coherent architecture and common programming model are crucial for large scale deployment of applications based on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Following the philosophy of active network, we construct a reference model for WSN architecture, which enables sensor nodes programmability, dynamic loading/unloading of protocols, and the online updating of codes. In addition, the new architecture can improve code reusability and reliability, and can shorten development and deployment cycle of large-scale commercial applications. Finally, it is capable of reducing management cost. On the other hand, exploiting the redundancy of densely deployed sensor nodes and the centripetal pattern (i.e. many-to-one) existing in traffic spatial distribution, and borrowing the concept of potential field in physics, we construct different potential fields referring to different state parameters in networks, and then superpose them into a virtual potential field to drive packets to move directionally in networks. This paradigm can realize the basic function of routing, while can endow additional attributes, including balancing energy consumption, alleviating congestion and assisting data aggregation. Additionally, the other related protocols in WSNs, such as reliable transport, time synchronization and congestion control, are developed.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,China's 100 Most Influential Academic Papers (2008);,Science and Technology Progress Award by City of Beijing, Second Class (2007);,Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, First Class (2005).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] F.Y.

My research team has initially proposed the 4over6 mesh architecture in the world, and designed and implemented 4over6 mesh protocol based on dynamic non-dominant tunnel. This has won high attention from IETF, and thus Softwire group was established. Based on this protocol, many national patents have been filed. I have published many papers in influential journals in the network field such as IEEE Internet Computing, and accomplished RFC 5565 and RFC 5747. Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA) has assigned a specific sub-address cluster identifier SAFI=67 to identify 4over6 function of network nodes. This protocol has been deployed to large-scale test on CERNET2, providing significant solution for pure IPv6 backbone building and IPv6 transition. It has been remarked as an international initiative by the technical appraisal committee including ten CAS and CAE fellows, and won the First-class Prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education in 2007.,Core routers are the key equipment of the Internet. I have participated in the overall design of IPv6 core routers, proposed IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel, and been responsible for the design and implementation of the subsystem. Having passed technical appraisal, our overall technology reaches international advanced and national top level. It has made major innovation in four key technologies including the tunnel setup scheme of realizing IPv4 on IPv6 networks. Among them, IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel and other two technologies have reached international advanced level. I have received the Second-class Award of National Science and Technology Progress Award, and Significant Technological Innovation Award by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.,Wireless network and mobile computing are significant directions of future Internet. I have studied the collaborative optimization routing framework based on backbone and access networks. Game optimization has been made on network transmission and user access. Multi-channel multi-path mesh backbone routing protocol has been designed using cross-level technologies. Besides, data center-oriented wireless mesh networking architecture and its key technologies have been proposed. Based on those research results, many important papers have been published, and my research group has been supported by Natural Science Foundation, international joint programs, and other funding.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,Influential Invention Award of China Information Industry-Key Technologies in IPv6 Core Router (2004);,Science and Technology Progress Award byChina Communications Standards Association(CCSA), First Class-IPv6 Core Router (2004);,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-IPv6 Core Router (2005);,China Computer Federation: Wang Xuan Award, First Class-IPv6 Core Router (2006);,Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, First Class-Demonstration Project of China Next Generation Internet (CNGI): Core Network CNGI-CERNET2/6IX (2007);,Nova Program of Science and Technology by City of Beijing (Type A) (2008).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Jianping Wu, Yong Cui, etc. 4over6 Transit Solution using IP Encapsulation and MP-BGP Extensions, IETF RFC 5747, 2010,[2] Jianping Wu, Yong Cui, etc. Softwire Mesh Framework, IETF RFC 5655, June 2009,[3] Yong Cui, Mingwei Xu, etc. ""IPv4/IPv6 Coexistence Framework (PET)"", IETF Internet draft, July, 2009.,[4] Yong Cui, Wenjie Hu, Sasu Tarkoma, Antti Yl -J ski.

In the domain of quantum architecture and systems, my collaborators and I have proposed redefining quantum instruction sets to unlock the full potential of quantum chips. We have introduced a series of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum instruction designs along with their microarchitectural implementations, significantly enhancing the accuracy of quantum program execution.,In the realm of quantum error correction and fault tolerance, we have developed a real-time quantum error decoding scheme that operates in the time domain, enabling scalable error correction. This approach has successfully reduced the per-cycle error processing time on superconducting quantum chips to within one microsecond, effectively resolving the backlog issue.,Building on this foundation, we have further advanced techniques such as vector processor acceleration for quantum computing and configurable quantum instruction sets, addressing the challenges of large-scale quantum chip addressing and control overhead. Leading a collaborative project, we have developed a complete system encompassing quantum instructions and control instructions, a quantum compilation framework, quantum error correction middleware, and control electronics. This work has realized the full-stack control of quantum chips, demonstrating a prototype implementation of a fault-tolerant quantum computing system, which has undergone initial testing and validation on actual quantum hardware.,I have published nearly 70 papers in leading journals and conferences across computer science and physics, including Nature Computational Science, Physical Review Letters, PRX Quantum, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Communications in Mathematical Physics, and ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing, as well as conferences such as QIP, ASPLOS, and DAC.,Academic Achievement,1.

In most IR tasks, user queries are always short and fuzzy, while the known document space is huge with complex information. Therefore, the main problem in IR lies in the mismatch of information representations between the user query space and the known document space. This is what my work is abased on. My research contributions are:,In the research of IR approaches to better document modeling, we studied the nature of novelty information, focusing on how to find new and non-redundant information to a user's request. We have proposed a document refinement approach based on query expansion, and a selective pooling-based document matching strategy. For document representation, an object-based document description is proposed. We also propose a unified generation model for topic relevance and opinion sentiments. The work has been published on important international journals and conferences, such as Journal of IR, SIGIR, CIKM, etc. One patent has been granted.,We are also leveraging wisdom of crowds and studying user behaviors based on large-scale user log data. Our proposed web page quality estimation and anti-spam algorithms are able to solve the robustness and timeliness problem of state-of-art technologies. Our automatic search engine performance evaluation approach handles the problems of the time and labor cost by human annotation. Currently, the automatic evaluation service for six main Chinese commercial search engines are daily provided online. We also study to understand user intentions, build user browsing graphs, and predict users' satisfaction level. Furthermore, we analyze the reliability of user behavior, and propose a model of user reliability and click relevance, which estimates the quality using both hot queries/clicks and long tail queries/clicks. This study has been published on important international journals and conferences, such as JASIST, WWW, WSDM, CIKM, etc. 8 patents have been filed, four of which were granted. Our proposed approaches have also been deployed on Sogou online search engine via ""Tsinghua-Sohu"" Joint Research Lab, and demonstrated good results and high potential in real web applications.,Several demos of our research projects can be found atSearchE Search Engine Performance Evaluation System,Top News Online Service, andSogou Laboratory Homepage.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,Tsinghua University Outstanding Teaching Award (2007).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Min Zhang, Xingyao Ye, A generative model to unify topic relevance and lexicon-based sentiment for opinion retrieval, The 31st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference (SIGIR2008), 20-24 July 2008, Singapore, p411-419.,[2] Canhui Wang, Min Zhang, Shaoping ma, Liyun Ru, Automatic Online News Issue Construction in Web Environment, the 17th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2008), Beijing, April, 2008, p457-466.,[3] Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Liyun Ru, Shaoping Ma.

Process algebras are among the most successful models of concurrent systems. One of the central notions of process algebras is bisimulation. However, it cannot be used to describe the approximate behaviour of concurrent systems. I proposed a new theory of topology in process algebras in order to describe the approximate correctness and evolution process of concurrent systems.,2.Floyd-Hoare Logic for Quantum Programs. Floyd-Hoare logic is a foundation of axiomatic semantics of classical programs, and it provides effective proof techniques for reasoning about the correctness of classical programs. To offer similar techniques for quantum program verification and to build a logical foundation of programming methodology for quantum computers, I developed a full-fledged Hoare logic for both partial and total correctness of quantum programs. In particular, the (relative) completeness of this logic is proved. The proof techniques are quite different from those for classical programs and need mathematical tools.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,National Natural Sciences Award, Second Class-Non-Classical Computation: Formal Models and Logical Foundations (2008);,Natural Sciences Award by Ministry of Education, First Class-Formal Methods for Complex Computer Systems and their Logical Foundations (2004);,China Association of Science and Technology: Young Scientists Award (1994).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] M.

I have participated as project leader or principal researcher in over 20 projects funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Social Science Foundation of China, National 863 High-Tech Program, National 973 Basic Research Program, as well as in projects funded by a number of international IT companies. I have published, together with my students, about 130 papers in academic journals and international conferences in the above fields. The total number of citations of these papers in Google Scholar is roughly 1,400. I have served as program committee member in numerous national and international conferences, and as conference chair or program committee chair for many times.,One of my research focus is Chinese word segmentation, the most fundamental issue in Chinese information processing. I have proposed some key concepts in word segmentation (such as maximal overlapping segmentation ambiguities, true and pseudo segmentation ambiguities, local and global statistics), and have developed an integrated Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging system, which is able to explore all sorts of knowledge, bigrams of words, parts-of-speech and characters, statistical and structural information of named entities, and local statistics of character strings. I have also tried to extend my experience in Chinese word segmentation to other languages in which word segmentation are need, resulting in an international standard ""ISO/FDIS 24614-1: Language Resource Management -- Word Segmentation of Written Texts -- Part 1: Basic Concepts and General Principles"". I am the only project leader for this ISO standard.,Recently, I have presented an original viewpoint in NLP: NLP based on huge-scale naturally annotated corpora. The basic idea is with Web-scale corpora, natural annotation may help machine better perform some NLP tasks. There are two types of natural annotation: explicit (such as punctuations, anchor text, query log, Wikipedia, blog tags) and implicit (such as language usage patterns). I further put forward a fundamental problem: if we could integrate all information drawn from naturally annotated corpora of different perspectives, are we able to achieve some degree of deep understanding of languages A preliminary work by my students and me published in Computational Linguistics 2009 showed the usefulness of punctuations in Chinese word segmentation, suggesting that this idea deserves further study.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,State Commission of Language Affairs: Nationwide Distinguished Practitioner (2007);,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Wei Qiao, Maosong Sun, Wolfgang Menzel.

Supported by National Science Foundation of China, National Basic Research Program (973), National 863 High-Tech Program and Advanced Defensive Research Project, series of research achievements have been achieved in stable neuro-fuzzy adaptive control and robust control of nonlinear systems, and filtering and control of Markovian Jump Systems. Significant achievements are listed as follows:,1. Stable Neuro-Fuzzy Adaptive Control of Nonlinear Systems. I have proposed a novel design idea of neural network-variable structure control. I have also developed systematic design approaches to the sampled-data adaptive control of (rigid/flexible link) robotic manipulators and a class of nonlinear systems. Those theoretical results have been verified by experiments. Representative paper of this research,""Neural Network-based Adaptive Controller Design of Robotic Manipulators with an Observer"", was awarded the first prize of the 18th Choon-Gang academic awards (Korea) in 2003.,2. Control and Filtering of Multi-Scale Nonlinear Systems and Markov Jump Systems.,A large class of practical plants, including flexible manipulators, flying wing aircrafts, catalytic reduction towers and large flexible space structures, can be described by multiple scale models with small perturbation parameters. I have proposed and proved the existence and sufficiency of approximation of multi-scale nonlinear systems using fuzzy singularly perturbed model (FSPM). I have also indicated the necessary condition of the universal approximator with a given precision. The adaptive and robust control approaches are developed based on both dependent and independent perturbation parameter solutions, which could obtain a significant control precision. Furthermore, effective methods are developed to address the saturation effect and incomplete measurable states in practical systems. I was invited to give a plenary speech in IEEE Intelligent System Design and Applications 2006 on this topic.,3. Application Researches. Since I joined Tsinghua University in 2001, I have supervised 20 master and 15 Ph.D students. Our research are related to some of the most important applications of neuro-fuzzy control methods in rigid and flexible-link manipulators, nonlinear systems, internetworked systems, space robots, etc. As of the experimental verification of our theoretical results, we have constructed two flexible-link robot test-beds and a teleoperation system for space on-orbit services. I have published 2 monographs, and filed 8 patent applications (3 authorized).,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,National Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholars (2006);,New Century Talents Award by Ministry of Education (2004);,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class (2002);,18th Choon-Gang Academic Awards (Korea) (2003);,Science and Technology Progress Award by City of Beijing, Second Class (2004).,National Distinguished Doctoral Dissertation (2000).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Fuchun Sun, Zengqi Sun, Bo Zhang.

Among them, I have been recently focusing on improving search performance with the help of semantic mining of user behaviors.,Due to the giant volume of Web information and limitations of current intelligent technologies, semantic analysis of on-line data faces lots of challenges. While billions of users are surfing the Web each day by means of direct typing of domain name, hyperlink on existing Web pages, or search engines, it is believed that their behaviors contain certain semantic information, which can be further utilized to help us better understand the semantic meanings of online data. Therefore, we work on this kind of information with the aim of improving the performance of Web search engines.,Our recent projects span over Web page quality estimation, Web spam page and illegal resource identification, search performance evaluation, on-line advertising performance evaluation, and search engine query recommendation. We have published a dozen of high-quality papers at important journals and conferences such as JASIST, WWW, CIKM, and WSDM.8 Chinese patents were filed and 3 of them have been authorized.Algorithms and systems developed in these projects have been successfully adopted by Sogou.com, one of the most popular search engines in China.,Demos of our research projects can be found at SearchE Search Engine Performance Evaluation System , and Sogou.com Laboratory .,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Rongwei Cen, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Bo Zhou, Liyun Ru, Shaoping Ma.

Quantum Complexity Theory.,Quantum interactive proofs form a central area in the theory of quantum algorithm complexity, with important connections to other branches of complexity theory and cryptography. Our research provides a complete characterization of two important complexity classes in this field, QIP and MIP*. Some of the related results have had interdisciplinary impact, addressing important open problems in theoretical physics and pure mathematics.,2. Quantum Cryptography.,Quantum computing is deeply connected to cryptography. In our work on quantum cryptography, we introduce the concept of pseudo-randomness to quantum state space, define the notion of pseudorandom quantum states, and establish their fundamental properties and applications. These results have not only influenced the field of quantum cryptography but have also recently been applied in research on quantum gravity and black holes. We construct quantum zero-knowledge proofs for languages in QMA, the quantum counterpart of NP, and investigate the quantum aspects of zero-knowledge proofs. Additionally, we propose a post-quantum cryptographic assumption based on tensor equivalence and design post-quantum secure digital signature protocols based on this assumption.,3. Quantum Information.,Quantum information theory and quantum entanglement theory form the foundational language of quantum computing. In collaboration with colleagues, we have solved several fundamental problems in quantum information theory and quantum entanglement theory. This includes introducing programmability to quantum channel parameter estimation problems, addressing the sample complexity of quantum state tomography, and answering the LU-LC problem for stabilizer states in the negative.,4. Quantum Software.,Quantum software is a core technology that is equally important as the development of quantum hardware. In collaboration with colleagues, we have proposed and developed the theory of bi-simulation for quantum communication concurrent systems (CCS), the theory of weakest preconditions for quantum programs, and the symbolic representation method for quantum circuits.,Publications,1.

Due to its mechanizability and ability to provide diagnostic information, it has been widely used in industry. We proposed two different quantum Markov chain models and systematically developed model checking methods for linear and branching quantum temporal logic formulas. In 2021, we published ""Model Checking Quantum Systems: Principles and Algorithms"" (Cambridge University Press), which systematically reviews this emerging research direction of quantum model checking, especially the work of our research group. This is the first academic monograph in the field of quantum model checking.,Quantum Program Verification: Hoare logic is the logical foundation of program verification and occupies a central position in program design methodology. Hoare logic defines appropriate axioms and inference rules for all program constructs of an imperative programming language, enabling (partial) automated proofs of program correctness. We established Hoare logic for quantum programs with classical variables, proving its soundness and relative completeness. This logic has been used to verify the complete Shor algorithm for the first time (ACM TQC 2021). Recently, we further employed this technique to design Hoare logic systems for quantum parallel programs without shared variables (TCS 2022), distributed quantum programs with classical communication (ACM TOCL 2022), and nondeterministic quantum programs(ASPLOS’23).,Quantum Communicating Systems: Quantum communication and cryptography are currently the most mature technologies in the field of quantum information. In order to formally describe quantum communication networks and lay a theoretical foundation for formal verification of quantum network software and communication protocols, we proposed the quantum process algebra qCCS (Information and Computation 2007). More importantly, we have successfully established a notion of bisimulation for quantum processes and proved its congruence for various process constructs (POPL’11, ACM TOPLAS 2012). Our subsequent works, including symbolic bisimulation (ACM TOCL 2014), open bisimulation (TCS 2012), and distribution-based bisimulation (CONCUR 2015), have greatly enriched the theoretical foundation of qCCS and enhanced its ability to describe and verify practical quantum communicating systems.,Academic Achievements,Books,[1].

In the area of 3D geometric data processing and modeling, I have proposed methods for point cloud denoising based on a generalized metric and optimization of surface mesh quality using anisotropic techniques. In 3D content editing, I have developed an algorithm and tool for segmentation based on Gaussian splatting. For dynamic 3D reconstruction, I have introduced an efficient modeling method based on sparse neural radiance fields. Additionally, in the field of fragment-based 3D reconstruction, I have proposed a deep learning algorithm for fragment assembly based on diffusion models.,Academic Achievement,[1] Qun-Ce Xu, Bailin Deng, Yong-Liang Yang.

I have led many national and international research projects and industrial projects. In recognition of my distinguished contributions, I won the National Scientific and Technological Progress Award (2nd class) twice in 1998 and 2001, National Technological Invention Award (2nd class) in 2004, as well as 5 provincial or ministerial awards. I also received the Prize of HLHL (Hong Kong) Foundation for Scientific and Technological Progress in 2005. I have filed 18 Chinese and 3 American patents as the first inventor, of which 17 Chinese and 1 American patents have been granted. Accordingly, I won the Top Patent Award of China in 2006. I have published over 180 technical papers on international journals and conferences, and I'm the author (or compiler) of 9 monographs or textbooks. I received IEEE Best Paper Award at the 21st IEEE AINA International Conference in 2007. I have made outstanding contributions to the engineering research and education of computing technology in China, in particular:,1. I have proposed and realized spatio-temporally extended von Neumann architecture-based thin clients, and have transferred this technology into real products, thus winning the National Technological Invention Award (2nd class) in 2004 and IEEE AINA 2007 Best Paper Award. To overcome the weakness (e.g., continuous upgrading, complicated operations, and low security) of traditional computers, I have started some research and implemented a new computing paradigm and platform based on pervasive computing, named Transparent Computing. This paradigm extends the von Neumann computer architecture to separate computation from storage of programs (including operating systems) spatiotemporally. The computation and storage of programs can be carried out by different machines connected by networks. In this way, users can select different operating systems (OSes) to run on the same hardware platform, thus solving the problem of running different big-size OSes and applications on small hardware platforms. These technologies have been transferred to Lenovo Beijing Corporation for real products, which are largely applied in many fields such as military, education, and business. Experts at CMU believed that this research is ""a very interesting innovation and may have significant implications for the design of future distributed systems"".,2. I have put forward several protocol synthesis theories or methods, and achieved a number of innovations in fundamental network theory research. I developed the first network-access router in China with independent intellectual properties, which significantly promoted the theoretical research and industrial development of network in China. I proposed and realized an interactive protocol synthesis method that can predict and prevent logical errors. This method is published on various IEEE transactions, with relevant content selected into Computer Advancement-a book published by American Scientific Publishing House, and is also cited by people in the field as Zhang's Protocol Synthesis Method. The first access router in China, referred to as SED-08, had been successfully industrialized and had been widely deployed in military, government, and other critical departments such as schools and enterprises.,3. I have proposed and implemented an active service method that can provide services to meet the ever-changing demands of users. According to the innovative ideas of software development, I defined the concept, architecture, and implementation framework of active services, and proposed a series of methods for multi-faceted construction, transformation, discovery, reorganization, compilation, and evolution in building software component warehouse. Based on the above-mentioned principles, I designed and implemented the prototype, and applied them to military information systems. The monograph entitled ""Active Service: Concept, Architecture and Implementation"", published by Chinese Science Press and Thomson Learning, was commented by Computer Journal of the United Kingdom as ""(it) breaks new ground in active services and program mining and is likely to be viewed in retrospect as a milestone in its field"".,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,China Academy of Engineering: Fellow (2007);,IEEE AINA 2007: Best Paper Award (2007);,Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation: Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress (2005);,National Technological Invention Award, Second Class-SOPCA Computer based on SOPCA Network Architecture (2004);,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-Computer Network Product: SED-08 Router (2001);,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-High-Speed Network Router SED-08B (1998).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Yuezhi Zhou and Yaoxue Zhang.

In the realm of intelligent perception, my initial work concentrated on tasks such as visual target detection, registration, tracking, segmentation, and recognition under unconstrained conditions. In recent years, I've delved into the integration of multimodal information for complex situational perception and analysis.,In the field of intelligent decision-making, I've crafted a research trajectory in game interactive learning. This involves amalgamating traditional game theory methods for problem representation modeling with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms for approximating solutions. Over 70 of my research papers have been published in international conferences and journals, accumulating over 17,000 Google Scholar citations. Notably, the algorithm for human attribute relationship perception received the Best Paper Award at ACM Multimedia 2013, the anchor-free single-stage online multi-object tracking algorithm secured the Best Paper Award at PRCV 2020, and the AlphaHoldem algorithm for large-scale imperfect information games was honored with the Distinguished Paper Award at AAAI 2022.,The intelligent perception and decision-making algorithms I've developed have garnered recognition in over ten significant technical competitions both domestically and internationally.

The visual media data that my group studied includes images, videos and 3D digital geometry. Here intelligent processing means that we explore and extract the inherent patterns in the visual media, characterize them using appropriate geometric structures (possibly after applying some non-linear feature transformations and dimension reductions), and use these geometric structures to design efficient algorithms that behave like assigning machine intelligence to the computer. As a typical example, my research work ""Sketch2Photo: Internet Image Montage"" has been voted as Top 10 Most Promising Digital Initiatives in 2010 by , France (). The research work of my group has been published on ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD), Computer Aided Design (CAD) and The Visual Computer (TVC). These papers have been cited by more than 1200 times.,Another direction of my research is dedicated security-focused operating system and middleware techniques. For reasons of disk economy and efficiency, reducing disk energy consumption and improving disk performance in high-performance computer systems are increasingly pressing issues. To achieve these goals, we define the concept of ISRA (Immediate Successor Relationship Amount) to represent the successor relationship of data blocks, and propose an ISRA-based grouping algorithm for disk reorganization, based on an undirected graph.

For cloud computing, targeting issues with cluster such as monotonous usage mode, limited application types support, and management complexity, I put forward a new virtualization model for multiple computing resources, which can support customization and auto deployment at the levels of hardware, operating system and applications, and developed a virtual computing system accordingly. In addition, I proposed a deduplication-based virtual machine (VM) image storage and transfer method that can both reduce space consumption and boost image distribution, and presented an approach for fast live cross-datacenter VM migration.,2. For big data storage, I devised a method to combine SSD (solid state drive) and HDD (hard disk drive) to meet the requirements of big data processing and showed how to use it to accelerate MapReduce execution. Also, I studied the issues of cloud-based data storage and sharing, and co-developed MeePo, a high available cloud storage system that had been applied to China Unicom Guangdong Branch, Huawei, ZTE, CNPC, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and so on, serving more than 1.5 million registered users and 6000 enrolled communities in total, and that won the State Technological Invention Award, 2ndclass in 2015.,3. For big data processing, to deal with MapReduce performance degradation on heterogeneous clusters, I put forward ActCap, a method that reduces inter-node data transfer (key cause of performance degradation) by node-capability-aware data placement; to improve MapReduce with skewed input data, I devised Skew--, a coordinated systematic solution that adopts complexity-aware keys assignment, a post-Map keys allocation scheme taking into account not only the number of keys, but also the Reduce task complexity and the key group size to balance the loads among Reducers, and other data locality and resource scheduling enhanced mechanisms to guarantee the benefit of post-Map keys allocation. ActCap can gain an average speedup of 49.8% over standard Hadoop YARN and 9.8% over Tarazu, whereas Skew-- can get an average speedup of 1.98x over standard Hadoop YARN, and 1.63x, 1.77x, and 1.41x (Reduce phase only) over SkewTune, Online Balancer, and TopCluster respectively.,Honors and Awards,Science and Technology Progress Award, 1stClass: Key Technologies of High-Reliable Storage System and Industrialization (2020);,Science and Technology Progress Award, Special Class: Key Technologies of Apsara Cloud Operating System and Industrialization (2017);,State Technological Invention Award, 2ndClass: High Available Cloud Storage System Oriented to Community Data Sharing (2015);,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation: Research Fellowship (2006);,First China Symposium on Web Semantics and Ontology: Best Paper Award (2006);,Tsinghua University: Outstanding Ph.D. Dissertation Award (2004);,Chinese Journal of Software: 100 Best Reviewers (2004).,Academic Achievement,[1] Mingxing Zhang, Teng Ma, Jinqi Hua, Zheng Liu, Kang Chen, Ning Ding, Fan Du, Jinlei Jiang, Tao Ma, Yongwei Wu.

Li from CEODE and Dr. X. Zhang from CAF) and I have been working on applying the theories and technologies of grid/distributed computing to the Earth Observation and Navigation domain. Contributions of our research include:,1. We proposed architecture for Spatial Information Grid (SIG), developed a runtime environment of SIG, and created the world's first SIG prototype in 2003.,2. To improve the flexibility of SIG services, we proposed an on-demand service mechanism, which outperforms traditional mechanism in mass-data processing. We have also researched on context-centric application automation methods for easier and quicker SIG application development. Our method automatically executes the procedures of situation acquirement, processing, and matching, and then generates a ""situational SIG application"" without any input from developers.,3. For the purposes of resource sharing and application execution, a series of SIG middleware have been developed, including SIG Container and SIG Runtime Environment (SIGRE). We have also designed and developed SIG Application Engine to provide runtime support and web-based user interfaces.,4. To address the issues of managing and distributing remote sensing data from multiple sources, we have designed and implemented a SIG-based distribution system, which dispatches remote sensing data from different sources and of different types and formats, and provides a one-stop on-demand service for data consumers.,5. We have been actively pushing our work to real application domains. Our first SIG prototype has drawn great attentions from international practitioners when presented in WGISS 2003. During ""5.12"" Sichuan earthquake in 2008, our SIG technologies were used to efficiently set up a remote sensing data distribution system from multiple sources such as USGS and ESA. Besides, our research on SIG has also been used in areas of forestry resource management, flood monitoring, and disaster response.,Administrative and Service Responsibilities,CEOS (Committee on Earth Observation Satellites): Member of WGISS (2007-).,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,Science & Technology Progress Award by City of Shanghai, First Class-ZiQiang 2000 High Performance Computer System SUHPCS (2001).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Z.C.

Together with other instructors in the systems course group (including those teaching Computer Organization, Operating Systems, Compilers, and teaching experiments), I actively participate in the ""curriculum reform aimed at cultivating computer systems capabilities."" This initiative has been recognized with the Second Prize of the National Teaching Achievement Award in Higher Education (2018) and the First Prize of the Beijing Municipal Teaching Achievement Award in Higher Education (2017).,Correspondingly, I have innovated the teaching content and structure of relevant courses. The undergraduate course I teach, ""Assembly Language Programming,"" was designated as one of the first batch of National Quality Shared Courses (2016) and one of the first batch of National First-Class Undergraduate Courses (2020).,I engage in research-oriented education (where undergraduates play a leading role in processor design and tape-out) and practice-oriented education (actively developing professional practice courses). The Ph.D. students I have supervised have been awarded the title of Outstanding Ph.D. Graduate at Tsinghua University (2020) and the 2020 ""CCF Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award"" by the China Computer Federation (CCF).,Research Projects,The National High-Tech R&D Program of China (The 863 Program): Development of Test and Evaluation System of Cloud Computing (2013-2015);,The MOE-Intel IT Program: Research on the Transparent SaaS usage model of Existing Teaching Software (2011-2013);,The National High-Tech R&D Program of China (The 863 Program): Overall Technologies of High-end Fault-tolerance Computers (2008-2011);,The National Natural Science Foundation of China： Architecture Research of Storage Chip-Multiprocessors with Object-data Support and Dynamic Function-extension (2008-2010);,The National Basic Research Program of China (The 973 Program)：Research on the Virtualization of Resources from Multi-computers (2007-2011);,The National High-Tech R&D Program of China (The 863 Program): Research on the Portable and Personalized Software based on Virtualization and Network Services (2006-2008);,The National High-Tech R&D Program of China (The 863 Program): Middleware of High-performance Clusters (2002-2004);,The National High-Tech R&D Program of China (The 863 Program): Development of a 32-bit High-performance Embedded Processor (2002-2004).,Research Status,Research Status,I conduct research on novel processor microarchitectures and the fundamental hardware / software of neuromorphic computing. Addressing the issues of ambiguous hierarchical interfaces and tight hardware-software coupling in neuromorphic computing systems due to the lack of a comprehensive theoretical foundation, we proposed the ""neuromorphic computing completeness"" inspired by the computational characteristics of neural networks, as well as a decoupled hardware-software hierarchy for neuromorphic computers and basic hardware primitives based on this completeness. It is demonstrated that such systems can support general-purpose computation, hardware completeness, and compilation feasibility for neuromorphic computing. These research findings have been applied to the development of the ""TianjiC"" neuromorphic chip, which targets artificial general intelligence, resolving the key issue of toolchain support for the fusion of heterogeneous networks. Based on these results, we designed a RISC-like neuromorphic chip and basic software that efficiently supports such hardware primitives, significantly enhancing performance. Subsequently, I proposed the design of a ""general-purpose"" neuromorphic computing chip and system, and leveraged the advantages of neuromorphic architecture to benefit general-purpose processors by designing a heterogeneous processor that integrates the strengths of neuromorphic architecture for general and sparse computing. This processor successfully underwent experimental tape-out in 2022 and 2025.,The paper on ""neuromorphic computing completeness"" was published in Nature (October 2020), marking the first Nature paper in the field of computer system architecture in China. It was recognized as a featured outcome at the 2020 World Internet Conference and one of the top ten global AI advancements by the BAAI (Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence). The ""TianjiC"" chip paper was published as a cover article in Nature (August 1, 2019), the first Nature paper in China's AI and chip fields, and was selected as one of China's top ten scientific advancements in 2019 and a leading scientific achievement at the 2019 World Internet Conference.

For the first time, a configurable software development tool for heterogeneous multi-core architecture has been implemented, solving technical challenges such as heterogeneous multi-core communication, distributed memory management, and cross core task scheduling. In terms of intelligent processor architecture, I have proposed a new type of ReRAM based LSTM accelerator architecture. By using neural network approximators to achieve vector computation in LSTM, multiple functional units in the system have a consistent architecture, optimizing hardware overhead for analog-to-digital and analog-to-digital conversion, and improving system computational efficiency.,Honors and Awards,First Prize of Technological Invention Award for Outstanding Scientific Research Achievements in Higher Education Institutions (2019),First Prize for Technological Invention of the China Electronics Society (2017),Publications,[1] Han, Jianhui; Wang, Mingyu; Liu, He; Li, Zhaolin; Zhang, Youhui.

In particular, I try to solve the problems of programming wall, memory wall, debugging wall and availability wall we face in parallel computing. In the recent two years, I have also been interested in mobile computing. My research in mobile computing aims at using cloud to manage operating systems, applications and data of mobile devices, and address the reliability, power and network bandwidth issues of current mobile computing platforms.,My research team has proposed a highly effective and low-cost technique which can be used to predict the performance of a high-performance computer early in the design phase. This technique is an elegant combination of compiler techniques, deterministic replay techniques and a high-fidelity trace-driven MPI simulator. In the area of compiler techniques, we investigate a new generation of iterative compilation techniques by employing feedbacks of production applications provided by hardware performance counters. Our idea significantly reduces the overhead of traditional feedback-based optimization approaches.,We have extensive collaborations with major industry companies on the above research areas. One of our research results, the MPI process placement optimization techniques, has filed a U.S. patent by Intel.,Honors And Awards,Honors And Awards,National Science and Technology Progress Award, Second Class-High Performance Cluster Computer and Massive Storage System (2007);,Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, First Class-Performance Evaluation of High Performance Computers (2009);,Science and Technology Progress Award by Ministry of Education, Second Class-DeepComp 2600 Network Server (2007).,Academic Achievement,Academic Achievement,[1] Chuntao Hong, Dehao Chen, Wenguang Chen, Weimin Zheng, Haibo Lin: MapCG: Writing Parallel Program Portable between CPU and GPU.
