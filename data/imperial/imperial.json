The clinical work was in collaboration with Mr Jim Miller, of Glasgow Royal Infirmary.\nA spin-off from the total elbow prosthesis was a system of radial head prostheses, for use in unstable fracture-dislocations of the elbow. These implants are still marketed by Stryker and by Corin.\n\nConcerns about joint stability led into work on artificial ligaments, with work initially on carbon fibres, but later on polyester fibres. This included collaboration with Professor Jimmy Campbell and Dr Susan Kempson, of the Edinburgh University Veterinary School, who used the implants for a large series of injured dogs' knees, and studied the tissue reactions to the fibres, showing the formation of new collagenous tissue on the polyester scaffold.\n\nThe polyester ligament system was then engineered for human use, including extensive fatigue-creep testing, in collaboration with DePuy Ltd and DuPont Ltd. A multi-centre clinical trial was set up, with particular collaboration with Mr Sadhan Mukherjee, of Airdrie Hospital, who introduced arthroscopic methods.\n\nAlthough artificial ligaments fell out of use, the work on the stability of the knee continued, with early work examining the roles of fibre bundles within the cruciate ligaments; that led to development of double-bundle ligament reconstruction methods which gave a closer approximation of natural knee laxity behaviour. This led to membership of both the Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligament Study Groups, and Andrew was the inaugural International Research Professor of the ACL Study Group in 2003.\n\nA related line of work was the measurement of complex knee instabilities, and work to attach electromagnetic sensors directly to the bones of patients during ligament surgery, and then later to splints for mounting the sensors on the skin, for routine clinical use.\n\nExpertise on both implant design and soft tissue mechanics has led to much work on the stability and kinematics of total and partial knee prostheses, attempting to understand how both implant design and surgical variables affect the behaviour of the replaced joint.\n\nIn addition to research work, Andrew has acted as a consultant and expert witness for a number of areas of work, includingimplant design, failures of orthopaedic implants, industrial injuries, and non-accidental injuries of infants.", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.amis/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Sonya Abraham", "title": "Honorary Senior Research Fellow", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.abraham", "position": "National Heart & Lung Institute - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Biography\n\nDr. Abraham is a Clinical Senior Lecturer in Rheumatology and General Internal Medicine.

Her research is focussed on sustainable metallurgy and supporting ethical practices in the development of metallurgical advances. \n\nHydrogen interaction in metal can be both advantageous and catastrophic. Hydrogen is beneficially used in the direct reduction of iron. The steel making industry accounts for 8% of worldwide CO2 emissions, and to achieve low carbon goals by 2050, alternative extraction methods must be developed. Traditional blast furnace techniques have an energy consumption of 19.8 GJ/t, yet direct reduction via hydrogen based low temperature electrolysis reduces this to 13 GJ/t. By developing corrosion resistant electrode materials for direct reduction via the understanding of hydrogen in this process, my group is increasing resilience in the UK steel supply chain, whilst contributing to the global responsibility of reducing CO2 emissions. \n\nContrarily, hydrogen embrittlement in structural metals can cause catastrophic failure of high-risk components. The fundamental effects of hydrogen in materials such as zirconium and titanium are not fully understood. Hydrogen transport and storage in renewable technologies has a need for protection against hydrogen embrittlement to prevent catastrophic failure. In detecting, measuring, and tracking hydrogen in these materials, a deeper understanding of current embrittlement theories can be formed. \n\nAbigail completed her BSc in Physics with Planetary Science at the University of Leicester in 2014. She then moved the Imperial College London to complete her PhD with Prof. David Dye on the topic of Microstructure Control in Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-6Mo, sponsored by Rolls-Royce plc., and industrially supervised by Prof. David Rugg. \n\nAbigail has previously worked with Dr. Stella Pedrazzini and Prof. Mary Ryan, designing and building unique corrosion test equipment to replicate in service conditions in gas turbine engines and industrial boilers, and with Prof. Baptiste Gault on understanding hydrogen embrittlement in titanium alloys. \n\nAbigail is passionate about supporting diversity and inclusion in materials science and is active in mentoring and outreach.

However, when it comes to clinical care, the primary method we still use to store and transfer most information between clinicians is through written letters - a literally ancient techology.\n \nCare for patients with multiple medical conditions, who are often prescribed complex combinations of medications, can be hindered by how poorly basic clincal information is structured and presented to clinicians. These and other inefficiencies in how we capture clinical data affect the quality and timeliness of care people are able to receive. In order to offer truly personalised care, and leverage recent advancements in data science for the benefit of patient groups, we need to capture appropriately high quality multi-dimensional clinical information as standard during routine care.\n \nI am keen to explore ways to improve how we capture and integrate multimodal data generated during routine clinical care - for the benefit of patients, clinicians, researchers and the organisation of healthcare services. I am creating tools tailored to addressing the needs of all interested parties. I am exploring ways in which these tools which utilise new technologies, might be able help provide better, more responsive, targeted and personalised care.\n \nMy current research focuses on dementia, but I aim to be fairly \"disease agnostic\"; always learning from, and applying insights in, other areas of neurology and clinical medicine more broadly.\n \nI'm always keen to hear from researchers, students or clinicians with similar interests and potential collaborators. Don't hesitate to get in touch if that's the case!\n \nBackground:\nI studied undergraduate medicine at University College London (UCL) and completed a PhD in cognitive neuroscience as part of UCL's MBPhD programme, supervised by Prof Eleanor Maguire at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging in Queen Square. My PhD research used virtual reality, behavioural, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to study parts of the brain important for forming memories and navigating through environments.\n \nI completed my general medical training in Barts Health NHS Trust, with a post on the NIHR Academic Foundation Programme. Research at this time centered around a theme of objective monitoring and risk prediction in pre-diagnostic stages of Parkinson’s Disease - developing a data driven approach to identify novel abbreviated versions of a smell test, and helping with improvements to the 'PREDICT-PD' algorithm for risk estimation in Parkinson’s disease in a large prospective cohort study of 10,000 individuals. This work was based at the Queen Mary University of London Preventive Neurology Unit, supervised by Prof Alastair Noyce.\n \nMy specialty training in Neurology has been based at Imperial College London, first through an NIHR Academic Clinical Fellowship and now an NIHR Clinical Lectureship. Research here initially focused on studying long-term patterns in human physiology and how they relate to brain function and neurological illness, based at the UK Dementia Research Institute Care Research & Technology Centre (UKDRI CR&T), of which Prof David Sharp is Director.\n\nRecently, I've grown increasingly frustrated by the gap between the potential of effective data use and what currently happens in routine clinical care worldwide. As a result, I am now focusing on developing ways to bridge this gap.

I received my PhD in economics from Harvard University, and was then a postdoctoral research fellow in the Economics Department and Nuffield College, University of Oxford.\n \nMy research seeks to understand the drivers of growth and structural transformation in lower income countries. I use high spatial resolution data from unconventional sources such as satellites and government administrative data exhaust to test for the role of place in shaping people's economic opportunities. I have published papers in the American Economic Review, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, Economic Journal, Review of Economics and Statistics, Management Science, and the World Bank Economic Review. Within this broader research agenda, I have papers studying i) the two way relationship between electoral politics and private sector development; ii) the impact of infrastructure (roads and canals) on the spatial distribution of economic growth; and iii) the role of cities and social identity in shaping access to economic opportunity. \n \nTogether with my longtime collaborator Paul Novosad, I founded Development Data Lab in 2019 to help policymakers, researchers, civil society, and the private sector make much better use of the large amounts of data being generated in lower income countries. For the first time in history, the computerization of government and the availability of alternative data sources like satellite imagery and private firm data make it possible to study the process of economic development at high resolution. We believe that economic opportunity is often a highly local phenomenon: children only benefit from nearby schools, and workers in a location can only access jobs within commuting range. We have spent the last decade assembling a wide range of economic data on every village and town in India (N=600,000): living standards, firms, infrastructure, agricultural productivity, etc. This is the basis of much of my research, but we have also made it publicly available through the SHRUG open data platform, which has been downloaded over 15,000 times to date. \n \nIf you are interested in working with me, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Systems capable of such a transformation are the recently discovered ‘Frustrated Lewis Pairs’ (FLPs) which are based on non-metal components such as amines and Lewis acidic boranes. In conjunction with efforts to design new thermally and hydrolytically stable FLPs, novel metal-based systems capable of effecting the reversible splitting of hydrogen are also being investigated. The primary goal is then to effect the hydrogenation of important small molecules (which are coordinated to transition metal based co-catalysts), mediated by sequential ‘proton coupled hydride transfer’ using activated hydrogen. Since hydrogen can be synthesised from the splitting of water using renewable solar energy we can obtain routes to the chemical storage of hydrogen and thus energy.\n \nUTILISATION OF THESE STRATEGIES ENABLES the design of multi-component systems to sustainably effect the:\n \nHydrogenation of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide into hydrocarbons and water.  \nIn the case of carbon monoxide this is known as the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process and is currently performed heterogeneously and at elevated temperatures and pressures; it generally exhibits poor selectivity. Since carbon monoxide can be made through the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (albeit endothermically), conducting this reaction in parallel with a homogeneous FT reaction (strongly exothermic) would enable the conversion of carbon dioxide and hydrogen into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons for use as carbon-neutral ‘green’ fuels, or feedstock chemicals (carbon sequestration). Such co-catalysts are based on mid-late transition metals of the 1st and 2nd row.\n \nFixation of dinitrogen to ammonia.  \nThe Haber process produces all synthetic ammonia from dihydrogen and dinitrogen that humans use for fertiliser to improve agricultural yields and hence help feed the world population. However, it does so at an immense energy cost (ca. 2% global energy demand) due to operation at high temperatures and pressure. Since iron is used in this process, and an iron-only nitrogenase has been discovered in Nature, co-catalytic dinitrogen iron(II) complexes are the focus of this research to devise a pathway for nitrogen hydrogenation at ambient temperatures and pressure.\n \nMany aspects of these transformations are applicable to an industrial context, where reactions are often conducted at high temperatures. Accordingly the design of new thermally robust ligands and their coordination complexes is an important aspect of our current methodology. All targets are homogeneous systems which are amenable to study using conventional techniques (e.g. NMR and IR spectroscopy) and thus offer the benefit of improving product selectivity through rational ligand modification.", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.ashley/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Qadeer Arshad", "title": "Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/q.arshad", "position": "Faculty of Medicine Centre - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Faculty of Medicine", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/q.arshad/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Chloe Armour", "title": "Research Associate", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/chloe.armour", "position": "National Heart & Lung Institute - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "BHF Centre of Research Excellence Fellow \nImage based computational modelling of pulmonary hypertension \nAssistant supervisor in the Xu Group, Department of Chemical Engineering", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/chloe.armour/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Alice Aveline", "title": "Research Postgraduate", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.aveline22", "position": "School of Public Health - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Alice Aveline is a research fellow in the Neonatal Medicine Research Group.

He is a PI in the Musculoskeletal laboratory (MSk) where he leads the Bone Health Group supervising a multidisciplinary team of clinical and non-clinical scientists. Richie has authored more than 60 journal articles and book chapters, that have been cited over 2700 times (H-Index 31). Richie is the co-creator and co-host of the BoneUp podcast which aims to empower people living with bone disease and their families. The podcast received the 2022 Neil Mackenzie Public Engagement Award from the Bone Research Society.\n \nRichie’s research pursues the evidence base for healthcare and environmental policy. His primary goals are to discover the mechanisms behind the remarkable mechanical properties of bone and better understand how ageing and environmental factors, like environmental pollution, modulate the response to mechanical loading, predisposing bones to osteoporotic fracture from the molecular scale up. Then apply the knowledge and evidence base to improve policy, diagnostics, and interventions for bone disease.\n \nHis technical innovations have resulted in new methods for studying tissue and organ mechanics from the molecular scale-up. His work included introducing synchrotron imaging methods to bone health research in humans. He combines synchrotron X-ray imaging techniques with microscopy and atomistic molecular dynamic modelling to determine the molecular and nanoscale mechanisms responsible for altering higher-scale mechanical properties in bone. Riche applies the methods to study the mechanisms underlying the effects of ageing and the environment on bone health and disease.\nRichie is translating the research by testing the application of bone health measures for clinical decision-making in surgery of the hip and spine. His work also includes the introduction of novel diagnostic and screening technologies in healthcare to improve the identification and treatment of osteoporosis. Richie works with companies developing healthcare technologies (e.g., X-ray and ultrasound) by supporting the design and delivery of preclinical and clinical trials. Richie also studies the natural history of bone stress injuries in dancers (ballet and contemporary) to improve the health and well-being of dancers and develop decision-making around ceasing and then returning to play.\nRichie is a JBMR Plus Editorial Board (2022-2024) and has served on numerous committees and working groups supporting research and translation including the Royal Osteoporosis Society (Cure Advisory Group, Technology Academy), The Diamond Light (K11 DIAD beamline), the British Orthopaedic Society (Secretary). He chaired the organising committee of the British Orthopaedic Society (2018) and sits on the Royal Osteoporosis Society Conference Committee (2023).\nRichie is well-known for his research investigating why some people age healthily whilst others sustain osteoporotic fractures. Their milestone papers are published in Scientific Reports (, ) and were featured on BBC Radio, ToDay programme 1/3/2017, Inside Health programme 14/3/2017, Guardian 13/3/2017, and Daily Mail 27/8/20. The work provided unique insight as it addressed bone mechanics at a near-molecular scale enabled by synchrotron diffraction experiments. The group is one of only a handful worldwide with demonstrated expertise to carry out these unique experiments.

This initiative is dedicated to advancing the transition to net-zero emissions by deepening our understanding of interface behaviours through a multidisciplinary approach that investigates morphology, structure and chemistry across scales, from the atomic to the macroscale and under extreme operational conditions. His role focuses on developing novel computational modelling techniques designed to bridge the gap between different scales, ergo linking atomic-level phenomena with macroscopic behaviours and offering critical insights that inform the design and optimisation of sustainable engineering solutions.\n\nDr. Ardah completed his PhD in the Tribology Group at Imperial College London under the supervision of Professor Daniele Dini and Dr. Tom Reddyhoff, in collaboration with Dr. Francisco J.

My research has increased the use of data in the management and monitoring of healthcare in the UK and internationally. My work has led to the development of innovative statistical and computational methods for processing large data sets derived from electronic medical records and NHS databases. In my work examining paediatric cardiac surgical outcomes for the Bristol Royal Infirmary Inquiry, I confirmed serious concerns around the surgical outcomes at Bristol and established the usefulness of routine administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics) in helping to identify quality of care issues.  In further research commissioned by the Shipman Inquiry and published in 2003, I established the role that statistical process control charts (specifically log likelihood CUSUM charts), and other routinely collected data (from death certificates) could play in the continuous surveillance of healthcare outcomes, and in this specific case, the detection of unusual patterns of patient mortality within General Practices.  I have demonstrated comparable (or better) coverage and completeness of routinely collected administrative data compared to clinical audit data. I have also demonstrated the strength of risk prediction models based on hospital administrative data compared to clinical data. I have developed indicators of healthcare performance based on hospital mortality patient safety indicators,and more recently stroke care and returns to theatre. I have also led the development of a national surveillance tool, the Real-Time Monitoring System (RTM as it is known), designed to monitor hospital outcomes across a range of diagnosis and procedure groups in near real time with data updated monthly. More recent research carried out by the unit since 2007 has refined this system, setting thresholds based on false alarm rates within CUSUM charts for multiple institutions, the automation of multiple risk adjustment models, the incorporation of hierarchical modelling techniques, the refinement of co-morbidity indices and the development of new indicators with potentially greater sensitivity than mortality.

Between 2011 and 2015 he completed a PhD at Imperial College using metabolic profiling to aid in the diagnosis of pneumonia in patients requiring critical care funded by the Imperial College BRC and the Intensive Care Foundation.\n \nAfter obtaining a dual CCT in Acute and Intensive Care Medicine in 2016 he returned to Imperial College to continue pursuing his academic interests in phenotyping critical illness.\n \nHis current research interests involve using a range of profiling techniques, including metabonomic, transcriptomic and inflammatory profiling, to identify sub-phenotypes in sepsis that could predict a patient's responsiveness to specific therapeutic strategies and lead to a personalised approach to sepsis care. This approach has lead to the finding that stratifying patients with septic shock based on the way in which their genes are expressed (sepsis response signature (SRS) transcriptomic endotypes) identified groups who respond differently to corticosteroids in this condition. Ongoing work aims to translate this finding to the bedside to use point of care tests to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from these interventions.\n \nONGOING PROJECTS: \nCorticosteroid Response and Gene Expression in Septic Shock (CRESS)\n \n(Winner of the Intensive Care Society Research Prioritisation Exercise, 2019)\n \nIn this project, I aim to translate findings from transcriptomic studies identifying a link between gene expression patterns and outcomes following corticosteroid use for septic shock to the bedside. The ultimate goal is to deliver a large scale, personalised medicine trial in septic shock where gene expression profiles would be used to guide treatment decisions.\n \nPhenotyping the Patient's Journey \n \nMetabolic Phenotyping or Molecular Phenomics uses metabonomic methods to examine 'metabolic fingerprints' of diseases and the way they change in response to treatment. In this, Imperial College BRC supported, project I am using these methods to track the metabolic trajectories of patients with septic shock with the intention of tracking responses to treatments and development of new organ dysfunction. Samples collected from two large, Imperial College run, septic shock randomised controlled trials (VANISH and LeoPARDS) are being  used to define and validate metabolic trajectories in this condition and will become one of the largest metabolic data sets in sepsis.\n \nStudy Evaluating Acute Dysfunction in balance and postural control after critical illness (StEADy)\n \nIncluding the Activate- (Muscle activation during early mobility strategies in health) pilot study\n \nIn collaboration with the Musculoskeletal laboratory, this project aims to establish patterns of trunk and peripheral muscle activity during recovery from critical illness. We aim to understand changes that occur to the control of balance and posture in response to critical illness.

Primarily, they encode conditional independence assumptions, whereby A is statistically independent of B conditional on the value of C. Just as conditional probability is one of the pillars of modern probability, conditional independence is critical in statistical modelling. It underlies model specification, and allows us to infer, elicit, and understand correlation structures between unobserved variables, given the value s of variables we already know. This course will entail a variety of material, including discrete mathematics (graph theory), statistical modelling, algorithms and computational aspects, as well as applications, involving real data and actual applications. We will also touch upon abstract questions, such as the difference between causality and correlation.\n\nOFFICIAL STATISTICS (M5MS18)\n\"Statistics are the mirror through which we view society\" (David Hand). How can the well-being of a nation be measured? Has the UK been faring better than Europe during the financial crisis? Were the policies of our government succesful? Sound policy making must rely on evidence, and the task of gathering such evidence reliably across a multitude of individuals, social groups, businesses and types of activities, is monumental. This is an exciting time for official statistics: the raw data are increasingly becoming available for public scrutiny, and recent developments are redefining what constitutes \"well-being\", \"progress\", and how they can be measured.", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/christoforos.anagnostopoulos06/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Ali Alsafi, FRCR, EBIR, FCIRSE, FRCP", "title": "Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.alsafi", "position": "Department of Surgery & Cancer - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "FRCR EBIR FCIRSE FRCP\n \nAli Alsafi is a consultant radiologist, dually accredited in diagnostic and interventional radiology.

Her research is focused on multiscale process and molecular/materials design, including the development of design methods, property prediction techniques and optimisation algorithms. She works extensively with industry, especially the oil and gas, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals sectors and has licensed thermodynamic modelling software. She is the Director of the Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering and Editor-in-Chief of the RSC-IChemE journal MSDE. \n \nThe molecular frontier: extending the boundaries of process design \nDr Adjiman's group brings molecular-level decisions into process design through fundamental advances in modelling and optimisation methods, and follows this through to implementation and application.\n \nIn designing new processes e.g., chemical processes, energy conversion devices – the molecules or materials required for processing (such as solvents or catalysts) are often chosen first. This is usually done from a limited set of choices (or design space) because evaluating many options, computationally or experimentally, is costly and time-consuming. Once this choice is made, the process topology and operating conditions can be chosen. This sequential decision making can lead to poor performance as it limits the design space and it ignores the intrinsic links between molecules and process. A simple question such as what is the best solvent for a reaction in a pharmaceutical manufacturing process cannot be answered in isolation. The answer depends on the reactor temperature and pressure, and on what follows in the process. If it is another reaction, it may be best to find a single solvent that works reasonably well for both reactions, to avoid expensive steps such as “swapping” one solvent for another, which often requires an energy-intensive separation.\n \nBy extending the boundary of process design to include molecular or material level decisions, real benefits can be accrued: better process economics, and lower environmental impact through increased material and energy efficiency. Further, by using optimisation to pose and solve extended design problems, the explicit evaluation of every design is avoided, making it possible to consider large design spaces: thousands of molecules, countless mixtures, wide temperature/pressure ranges, unusual process topologies. A few promising designs can be assessed experimentally to verify the results of model-based design. This general methodology, integrated molecular and process design, has been singled out for its potential to enhance innovation and competitiveness.\n \nExplore the links below, research pages and publications to learn more.\n \nFIND OUT MORE \nFor an introduction to the group's work, watch Claire's inaugural lecture entitled \"Molecules on best behaviour: The engineering of molecular systems\" \n \nLinks \nThe Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering \nMolecular Systems Engineering \nInstitute for Molecular Science and Engineering.

This bivalent marking is proposed to prime lineage-specifying genes for future activation yet prevent their premature expression through Polycomb-mediated repression. \n \nIn 2006 Véronique started her independent research group at the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology (IRDB) of Imperial College London supported by an MRC Collaborative Career Development Award in Stem Cells and a BBSRC New Investigator Award. Her group has since focussed on understanding how cell potency and differentiation are balanced in stem cells and in the developing mammalian embryo. In the early embryo, this implies unravelling how cell heterogeneity arises, how pluripotency is achieved and safeguarded while promoting the formation of essential extra-embryonic lineages, and how the pluripotent embryonic tissue itself is remodelled upon implantation in preparation for all subsequent differentiation events and foetal growth. Combining in vivo studies with embryo stem cell models, her group pursues a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach to address these questions from transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic perspectives. Most recently, her group uncovered a previously unrecognized link between lipid metabolism and the morphogenesis of pluripotent stem cell progenitors during peri-implantation development, with a specific focus on lipid droplet biology. \n \nThroughout her journey, Véronique grew an active interest in developing others as the mother of two daughters, a caring research group leader and mentor, teaching module leads and tutor, a university-wise champion for early career researchers as well as acting as departmental lead in research culture/Athena Swan. In 2024, she was awarded an Imperial President’s Medal for Excellence in Research Environment (Ethics, Culture, and Sustainability).\n\nInvisible disability and neurodiversity (auditory processing disorder/APD and co-occurring dyslexia).", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/v.azuara/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Mo Akmal", "title": "Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.akmal", "position": "Department of Surgery & Cancer - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Faculty of Medicine", "photo_url": null},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Olivia Atkins", "title": "Research Postgraduate", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/o.atkins24", "position": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering - Faculty of Engineering", "bio": "Faculty of Engineering", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/o.atkins24/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Azusa Asai", "title": "Visiting Researcher", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/a.asai", "position": "Department of Life Sciences - Faculty of Natural Sciences", "bio": "Faculty of Natural Sciences", "photo_url": null},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Amish Acharya", "title": "Scientific Advisor to Professor Darzi", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/amish.acharya07", "position": "Department of Surgery & Cancer - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Faculty of Medicine", "photo_url": null},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Kleopatra Alexiadou", "title": "Visiting Reader", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/k.alexiadou", "position": "Department of Medicine - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "NIHR Clinical Lecturer in Endocrinology and Diabetes\nImperial College London, Imperial College London, London, United KingdomAug 2017 - Aug 2023\nPostdoctoral Clinical Fellow\nThe Francis Crick Institute, Molecular Cell Biology of Autophagy Lab, London, United Kingdom29 Aug 2023 - present", "photo_url": null},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Santosh Atanur", "title": "Honorary Lecturer", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/santosh.atanur", "position": "National Heart & Lung Institute - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Genomic Data Scientist\nImperial College London, Department of Medicine, London, United Kingdom6 Apr 2016 - present\nChancellor's Fellow\nUniversity of Edinburgh, IGMM, UK1 Apr 2014 - 30 Apr 2016\nGenomic Data Analyst\nImperial College London, BHF Centre of Research Excellence, London, United Kingdom1 Jan 2009 - 31 Mar 2014\nResearch Associate\nMRC CSC, London, United Kingdom6 Jan 2008 - 1 Jan 2009\nMember Technical Staff\nCentre for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, India1 Jan 2003 - 31 Dec 2007", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/santosh.atanur/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Neha Ahuja", "title": "Principal Clinical TF in Primary Care", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/neha.ahuja", "position": "School of Public Health - Faculty of Medicine", "bio": "Faculty of Medicine", "photo_url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/neha.ahuja/photo"},{"university": "Imperial College London", "name": "Marco Aurisicchio", "title": "Reader in Engineering Design", "url": "https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.aurisicchio", "position": "Dyson School of Design Engineering - Faculty of Engineering", "bio": "Dr Marco Aurisicchio is Reader - Associate Professor - in Engineering Design in the Dyson School at Imperial College London.
