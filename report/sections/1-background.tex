\section{Background \& Motivation}

At first we wanted to make a search engine for humans. Much like OSINT where you can search for people and find their social media accounts, contact information, and other personal data. We thought this would be a great idea because it would allow people to find others easily and quickly.

However, we realized that most of the data available online is from social media sites such as: LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. And that scraping these sites is against their terms of service. So we decided to make a search engine for professors from the top ranked universities in the world. 

What we ended up with is \textbf{Sorgle} (profes\textbf{sor} goo\textbf{gle}), a search engine that allows users to search for professors from the top ranked universities in the world.
