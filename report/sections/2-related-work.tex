Early inspiration came from OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tools used in cybersecurity to gather publicly available personal data. For example, ContactOut \cite{contactout} scrapes LinkedIn profiles to provide email addresses and phone numbers. 

Another notable OSINT tool is Mr.Holmes \cite{mrholmes}, which is designed to automate the process of gathering intelligence from various online sources. Mr.Holmes aggregates data from social media platforms, public records, and other web resources.

However, a big part of Mr.Holmes is the use of google dorking, which is a technique that uses advanced search operations to find specific information on the web. For example, a typical dork query to find publicly available PDF files on a specific domain might look like:
\begin{verbatim}
site:example.com filetype:pdf
\end{verbatim}
This technique uses an already existing search engine, and it wouldn't make sense to build a new search engine that relies heavily on it.
